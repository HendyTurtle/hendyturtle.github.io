D. 他们的忠实朋友和仆人， C. D.<br><br><br><br>December , 1843. 1843 年 12 月<br><br><br><br>STAVE ONE. MARLEY’S GHOST. Marley was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that. The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and Scrooge’s name was good upon ’Change, for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail.<br><br>第一乐章。马雷的鬼魂。马雷已经死了：这是毫无疑问的。他的葬礼登记簿上有牧师、文书、殡仪员和主要哀悼者的签名。斯克鲁奇签了名：斯克鲁奇的签名在交易所里是值得信赖的，无论他做什么。老马雷死得像门钉一样。<br><br><br><br>Mind! I don’t mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the Country’s done for. You will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as dead as a door-nail.<br><br>注意！我并不是说我自己的知识里特别知道门钉有什么特别死的地方。我自己可能会倾向于认为棺材钉是贸易中最死气沉沉的铁器。但祖先的智慧在于这个比喻；我的不洁之手不会打扰它，或者这个国家就完了。因此，请允许我明确地重复，马雷死得就像一枚门钉一样。<br><br><br><br>Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise? Scrooge and he were partners for I don’t know how many years. Scrooge was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain.<br><br>Scrooge 知道他已经死了？当然他知道。怎么可能不是呢？Scrooge 和他已经做了多少年的合伙人。Scrooge 是他唯一的执行人，唯一的行政官，唯一的受让人，唯一的遗产继承人，唯一的朋友，唯一的悼念者。即使 Scrooge 在葬礼那天也没有被这个悲伤的事件搞得如此凄惨，他还是一位出色的商人，并且用无疑的划算的交易来庄严地举行了葬礼。<br><br><br><br>The mention of Marley’s funeral brings me back to the point I started from. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet’s Father died before the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts, than there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy spot—say Saint Paul’s Churchyard for instance—literally to astonish his son’s weak mind.<br><br>提到 Marley 的葬礼让我回到了我开始的点。毫无疑问，Marley 已经死了。这一点必须明确理解，否则我即将讲述的故事中不会有任何奇妙之处。如果我们没有完全确信哈姆雷特的父亲在戏开始之前就已经去世，那么他在一个东风吹拂的夜晚在自己的城墙上散步，与任何其他中年绅士在黑暗中冒险走出一个有风的地方——比如说圣保罗教堂墓地——实际上去震惊他儿子的脆弱心灵相比，不会有任何更引人注目的地方。<br><br><br><br>Scrooge never painted out Old Marley’s name. There it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was known as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It was all the same to him.<br><br>斯克鲁奇从未抹去老马利的名字。多年后，这个名字仍矗立在仓库门上方：斯克鲁奇与马利。这家公司以斯克鲁奇与马利著称。有时新入行的人把斯克鲁奇叫斯克鲁奇，有时叫马利，但他对这两个名字都应答如流。对他来说，都一样。<br><br><br><br>Oh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his own low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the dog-days; and didn’t thaw it one degree at Christmas.<br><br>哦！但他在磨刀石旁是个吝啬鬼，斯克鲁奇！一个挤压、扭曲、抓取、刮擦、紧握、贪婪的老罪人！硬如燧石，从未从中迸发出慷慨的火花；神秘、内向、孤独，就像牡蛎。他内心的寒冷冻结了他的老脸庞，咬住了他尖锐的鼻子，萎缩了他的脸颊，僵硬了他的步伐；使他的眼睛发红，薄唇发蓝；用他那刺耳的声音狡猾地说话。他的头顶、眉毛和瘦削的下巴上覆盖着冰霜。他总是带着自己低沉的温度；在酷暑中，他把办公室冰冻起来；在圣诞节也不升温一度。<br><br><br><br>External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn’t know where to have him. The heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage over him in only one respect. They often “came down” handsomely, and Scrooge never did.<br><br>外部炎热和寒冷对斯克鲁奇影响甚微。没有任何温暖能让他感到温暖，任何冬季的天气都无法让他感到寒冷。没有任何风比他更刺骨，没有任何下落的雪比它更有目的性，没有任何倾盆大雨比它更不轻易接受恳求。恶劣的天气不知道把他放在哪里。最重的雨、雪、冰雹和雨夹雪，在唯一一点上能自诩胜过他。它们经常“洋洋洒洒”地落下，而斯克鲁奇从未如此。<br><br><br><br>Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, “My dear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?” No beggars implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was o’clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men’s dogs appeared to know him; and when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into doorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they said, “No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!”<br><br>没有人曾在街上拦住他，带着愉快的表情说：“亲爱的斯克鲁奇，你好吗？你什么时候来看我？” 没有乞丐恳求他施舍一点，没有孩子问他现在几点，在他的一生中，没有人询问过斯克鲁奇去某个地方的路。即使是盲人的狗似乎也认识他；当他们看到他走来时，会拉扯他们的主人进入门廊和庭院；然后摇尾巴，好像在说：“没有眼睛总比邪恶的眼睛、黑暗的主人好！”<br><br><br><br>But what did Scrooge care! It was the very thing he liked. To edge his way along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep its distance, was what the knowing ones call “nuts” to Scrooge.<br><br>但斯克鲁奇在乎什么！这正是他所喜欢的。沿着人潮拥挤的人生道路前行，警告所有人类的同情心保持距离，这就是那些明白人称之为“疯狂”的事情。<br><br><br><br>Once upon a time—of all the good days in the year, on Christmas Eve—old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak, biting weather: foggy withal: and he could hear the people in the court outside, go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The city clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already—it had not been light all day—and candles were flaring in the windows of the neighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense without, that although the court was of the narrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuring everything, one might have thought that Nature lived hard by, and was brewing on a large scale.<br><br>从前——在一年中所有的好日子里，在平安夜——老斯克鲁奇坐在他的账房里忙碌着。天气寒冷、阴郁、刺骨：雾蒙蒙的：他可以听到外面庭院里的人们喘着气上下走动，用手拍打自己的胸口，用脚跺在人行道上取暖。城市时钟刚刚过了三点，但已经相当黑暗了——一整天都没有亮过——邻办公室的窗户里蜡烛闪烁，像鲜红的涂抹在可触摸的棕色空气中。雾从每一个缝隙和钥匙孔涌进来，外面如此浓密，尽管庭院很窄，对面的房子也只是一些幽灵。看到那肮脏的云朵垂下来，遮蔽了一切，人们可能会认为大自然就在附近，正在大规模地酿造着什么。<br><br><br><br>The door of Scrooge’s counting-house was open that he might keep his eye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk’s fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn’t replenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so surely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his white comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which effort, not being a man of a strong imagination, he failed.<br><br>Scrooge 的账房门敞开着，这样他就能监视他的职员。职员在一个阴暗的小房间里，像是一个水箱，正在抄写信件。Scrooge 的火很小，但职员的火更小，看起来就像一块煤。但他无法补充燃料，因为 Scrooge 把煤箱放在自己的房间里；每当职员拿着铲子进来，主人就会预言他们必须分开。因此，职员穿上他的白色毯子，试图在蜡烛旁取暖；但作为一个想象力不强的人，他失败了。<br><br><br><br>“A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!” cried a cheerful voice. It was the voice of Scrooge’s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this was the first intimation he had of his approach.<br><br><br><br>“Bah!” said Scrooge, “Humbug!”<br><br>“圣诞快乐，叔叔！愿上帝保佑你！”一个欢快的声音喊道。这是 Scrooge 侄子的声音，他来得如此之快，以至于这是他第一次意识到他的到来。 “呸！”Scrooge 说，“胡说八道！”<br><br><br><br>He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this nephew of Scrooge’s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and handsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.<br><br>他因为雾和霜中快速行走而热得满脸通红，这个斯克鲁奇的外甥，他的脸红润而英俊；他的眼睛闪烁，呼吸又冒起了白烟。<br><br><br><br>“Christmas a humbug, uncle!” said Scrooge’s nephew. “You don’t mean that, I am sure?”<br><br>“圣诞节是个骗局，叔叔！”斯克鲁奇的外甥说。“我敢肯定你不是这个意思？”<br><br><br><br>“I do,” said Scrooge. “Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry? What reason have you to be merry? You’re poor enough.”<br><br>“我是，”斯克鲁奇说。“圣诞快乐！你有什么理由快乐？你有什么理由快乐？你已经够穷了。”<br><br><br><br>“Come, then,” returned the nephew gaily. “What right have you to be dismal? What reason have you to be morose? You’re rich enough.”<br><br>“来吧，”侄子愉快地回答，“你有什么权利这么沮丧？你有什么理由这么忧郁？你很富有啊。”<br><br><br><br>Scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said, “Bah!” again; and followed it up with “Humbug.”<br><br>斯克鲁奇一时找不到更好的回答，又说了声“呸！”接着又加上一句“胡说八道。”<br><br><br><br>“Don’t be cross, uncle!” said the nephew.<br><br>“别生气，叔叔！”侄子说。<br><br><br><br>“What else can I be,” returned the uncle, “when I live in such a world of fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What’s Christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time for finding yourself a year older, but not an hour richer; a time for balancing your books and having every item in ’em through a round dozen of months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,” said Scrooge indignantly, “every idiot who goes about with ‘Merry Christmas’ on his lips, should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart. He should!”<br><br>“我还能是什么，”叔叔回答，“当我在这样一个傻瓜的世界里生活时？圣诞快乐！去他的圣诞快乐！对你来说，圣诞节时间是什么？不过是没钱付账的时候；是发现自己又老了一岁，但没富一个小时的时候；是平衡你的账本，让每个月的每一项都像死一样压在你身上的时候？如果我能行我的意愿，”斯克鲁奇愤怒地说，“每一个嘴上挂着‘圣诞快乐’的白痴，都应该被自己的布丁煮熟，然后被一根冬青树枝贯穿心脏埋葬。他应该！”<br><br><br><br>“Uncle!” pleaded the nephew.<br><br>“叔叔！”侄子恳求道。<br><br><br><br>“Nephew!” returned the uncle sternly, “keep Christmas in your own way, and let me keep it in mine.”<br><br>“侄子！”叔叔严厉地回答，“按照你自己的方式过圣诞，让我按照我的方式过。”<br><br><br><br>“Keep it!” repeated Scrooge’s nephew. “But you don’t keep it.”<br><br>“保持它！”斯克鲁奇侄子重复道。“但你并没有保持它。”<br><br><br><br>“Let me leave it alone, then,” said Scrooge. “Much good may it do you! Much good it has ever done you!”<br><br>“那让我让它独自去吧，”斯克鲁奇说。“它可能对你大有裨益！它一直对你大有裨益！”<br><br><br><br>“There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I have not profited, I dare say,” returned the nephew. “Christmas among the rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas time, when it has come round—apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that—as a good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore, uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I believe that it has done me good, and will do me good; and I say, God bless it!”<br><br>“我敢说，有很多事情我本可以通过它们得到好处，但我却没有得到，比如圣诞节。”侄子回答说。“圣诞节也是其中之一。但我确信，每当圣诞节到来的时候——除了对它神圣的名字和起源应有的尊敬之外，如果任何与它有关的东西可以与那分开的话——它都是一个美好的时光；一个仁慈、宽容、慈善、愉快的时光；是我所知道的，在漫长的日历中，唯一一个男女似乎一致地打开他们紧闭的心扉，把下面的人当作真正的旅伴来思考，而不是另一种种族的生物，他们注定要踏上不同的旅程。因此，叔叔，尽管它从来没有让我口袋里多出一分钱或一厘银，我相信它对我有好处，将来也会有好处；我说，上帝保佑它！”<br><br><br><br>The clerk in the Tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the last frail spark for ever.<br><br>店员在坦克里不自觉地鼓起掌来。他立刻意识到这样做不合适，于是戳了戳火，永远熄灭了那最后一点微弱的火星。<br><br><br><br>“Let me hear another sound from you ,” said Scrooge, “and you’ll keep your Christmas by losing your situation! You’re quite a powerful speaker, sir,” he added, turning to his nephew. “I wonder you don’t go into Parliament.”<br><br>“让我再听到你说的其他声音，”斯克鲁奇说，“你就得通过失去你的职位来过圣诞节了！你真是个有说服力的演说家，先生，”他转向他的侄子补充道，“我真不明白你为什么不去议会。”<br><br><br><br>“Don’t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.”<br><br>“再让我听到你发出一点声音，”斯克鲁奇说，“你就得通过失去你的职位来度过圣诞节了！你真是个有说服力的演说家，先生，”他转向他的侄子补充道，“我真不明白你为什么不去议会工作。” “别生气，叔叔。来吧！明天和我们一起吃饭。”<br><br><br><br>Scrooge said that he would see him—yes, indeed he did. He went the whole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that extremity first.<br><br>Scrooge 说他要去看他——是的，他确实去了。他完全表达了他的意思，说他首先会去看他处于这种绝境。<br><br><br><br>“But why?” cried Scrooge’s nephew. “Why?”<br><br><br><br>“Why did you get married?” said Scrooge.<br><br>“但是为什么？”Scrooge 的侄子喊道。“为什么？” “你为什么要结婚？”Scrooge 问。<br><br><br><br>“Because I fell in love.”<br><br>因为我坠入爱河了。<br><br><br><br>“Because you fell in love!” growled Scrooge, as if that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. “Good afternoon!”<br><br>因为你坠入爱河了！斯克鲁奇咆哮着，仿佛这比一个欢乐的圣诞节更荒谬的事情再也没有了。“下午好！”<br><br><br><br>“Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give it as a reason for not coming now?”<br><br>不，叔叔，但在那之前您从未来看过我。为什么现在以此为不来见我的理由？<br><br><br><br>“Good afternoon,” said Scrooge.<br><br>“下午好，”斯克鲁奇说。<br><br><br><br>“I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be friends?”<br><br>“我什么都不想从你那里得到；我向你要求什么；为什么我们不能成为朋友？”<br><br><br><br>“Good afternoon,” said Scrooge.<br><br>“下午好，”斯克鲁奇说。<br><br><br><br>“I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never had any quarrel, to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial in homage to Christmas, and I’ll keep my Christmas humour to the last. So A Merry Christmas, uncle!”<br><br>我非常遗憾，真心地发现你如此坚定。我们从未有过任何争吵，我从未参与其中。但我已经为了向圣诞节致敬而进行了尝试，我会保持我的圣诞幽默到最后。所以，圣诞快乐，叔叔！<br><br><br><br>“Good afternoon!” said Scrooge.<br><br><br><br>“And A Happy New Year!”<br><br><br><br>“Good afternoon!” said Scrooge.<br><br><br><br>His nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned them cordially.<br><br><br><br>“There’s another fellow,” muttered Scrooge; who overheard him: “my clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking about a merry Christmas. I’ll retire to Bedlam.”<br><br><br><br>This lunatic, in letting Scrooge’s nephew out, had let two other people in. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with their hats off, in Scrooge’s office. They had books and papers in their hands, and bowed to him.<br><br>这个疯子，在让 Scrooge 的侄子出去时，让另外两个人进来了。他们是两位体面的绅士，看起来很愉快，现在他们摘下帽子站在 Scrooge 的办公室里。他们手里拿着书籍和文件，向他鞠躬。<br><br><br><br>“Scrooge and Marley’s, I believe,” said one of the gentlemen, referring to his list. “Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr. Marley?”<br><br>“我相信是 Scrooge 和 Marley 的，”一位绅士指着他的名单说。“我有幸与 Scrooge 先生还是 Marley 先生交谈吗？”<br><br><br><br>“Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,” Scrooge replied. “He died seven years ago, this very night.”<br><br>“马雷先生已经去世七年了，”斯克鲁奇回答说。“他就是在七年前的这个夜晚去世的。”<br><br><br><br>“We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving partner,” said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.<br><br>我们毫无疑问，他的慷慨由他的幸存合伙人很好地代表了，”那位绅士说着，展示着他的证件。<br><br><br><br>It certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous word “liberality,” Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the credentials back.<br><br>这确实如此；因为他们曾是两个灵魂。在听到那个不吉利的词“慷慨”时，斯克鲁奇皱起了眉头，摇了摇头，然后把证书还了回去。<br><br><br><br>“At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,” said the gentleman, taking up a pen, “it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the Poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.”<br><br>“在这个节日的季节，斯克鲁奇先生，”绅士拿起笔说，“我们为穷人和无家可归的人提供一些微薄的援助，比平时更为必要。现在有成千上万的人急需基本生活必需品；成百上千万的人急需基本的生活舒适，先生。”<br><br><br><br>“Are there no prisons?” asked Scrooge.<br><br>“难道没有监狱吗？”斯克鲁奇问道。<br><br><br><br>“Plenty of prisons,” said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.<br><br>“监狱很多，”那位绅士放下笔说。<br><br><br><br>“And the Union workhouses?” demanded Scrooge. “Are they still in operation?”<br><br>“联合收容所呢？”斯克鲁奇问道。“它们还在运营吗？”<br><br><br><br>“They are. Still,” returned the gentleman, “I wish I could say they were not.”<br><br>“是的，还在，”那位绅士回答，“但愿我能说它们已经不存在了。”<br><br><br><br>“The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?” said Scrooge.<br><br>“那么，跑步机和贫困法都在全力实施中，对吧？”斯克鲁奇说。<br><br><br><br>“Both very busy, sir.” “两位都很忙，先生。”<br><br><br><br>“Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had occurred to stop them in their useful course,” said Scrooge. “I’m very glad to hear it.”<br><br>“哦！根据你最初说的，我担心发生了什么事阻止了他们继续有益的工作，”斯克鲁奇说。“很高兴听到这个。”<br><br><br><br>“Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude,” returned the gentleman, “a few of us are endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and means of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all others, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I put you down for?”<br><br>“他们认为几乎不能给大众带来心灵或身体的基督教慰藉，”那位绅士回答，“我们中的一些人正在努力筹集资金，为穷人买些肉和饮料，以及保暖的东西。我们选择这个时候，因为这是所有时候中最能深切感受到贫困，而丰盛则欢欣的时刻。我应该为你记下什么？”<br><br><br><br>“Nothing!” Scrooge replied.<br><br>“什么！”斯克鲁奇回答道。<br><br><br><br>“You wish to be anonymous?”<br><br>“你希望匿名吗？”<br><br><br><br>“I wish to be left alone,” said Scrooge. “Since you ask me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer. I don’t make merry myself at Christmas and I can’t afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the establishments I have mentioned—they cost enough; and those who are badly off must go there.”<br><br>“我想一个人独处，”斯克鲁奇说。“既然你们问我希望什么，先生们，这就是我的回答。我自己在圣诞节不会快乐，我也负担不起让闲散的人快乐。我支持我提到的那些机构——它们的花费已经足够大；那些生活困难的人必须去那里。”<br><br><br><br>“Many can’t go there; and many would rather die.”<br><br>许多人不能去那里；许多人宁愿死去。<br><br><br><br>“If they would rather die,” said Scrooge, “they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population. Besides—excuse me—I don’t know that.”<br><br>“如果他们宁愿死去，”斯克鲁奇说，“他们最好去死，减少过剩的人口。此外——请原谅——我不知道。”<br><br><br><br>“But you might know it,” observed the gentleman.<br><br>“但你可能知道，”那位绅士说。<br><br><br><br>“It’s not my business,” Scrooge returned. “It’s enough for a man to understand his own business, and not to interfere with other people’s. Mine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!”<br><br>“这不关我的事，”斯克鲁奇回答。“一个人只要明白自己的事，不去干涉别人的就足够了。我的事情一直占据着我的时间。下午好，先生们！”<br><br><br><br>Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion of himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.<br><br>清楚地看到继续坚持他们的观点是徒劳的，绅士们离开了。斯克鲁奇带着对自己改进的看法重新开始工作，并且比平时更加幽默。<br><br><br><br>Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with flaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in carriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church, whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down at Scrooge out of a Gothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and quarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became intense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers were repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier, round which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug being left in solitude, its overflowings sullenly congealed, and turned to misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops where holly sprigs and berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy as they passed. Poulterers’ and grocers’ trades became a splendid joke: a glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord Mayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his fifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor’s household should; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on the previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets, stirred up to-morrow’s pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef.<br><br>与此同时，雾和黑暗变得越来越浓重，人们手持火把四处奔跑，提供自己的服务，为马车引路，并引导它们前行。教堂古老的塔楼，其粗犷的老钟总是偷偷地从墙上的哥特式窗户向下窥视斯克鲁奇，变得看不见了，它在云中敲击时辰和刻度，之后以颤抖的振动，仿佛它的牙齿在那里冰冻的头上颤抖。寒冷变得非常强烈。在主要街道的街角，一些劳工正在修理煤气管道，并在一个铁锅中点燃了一堆大火，一群衣衫褴褛的男男女女围坐在火堆旁：在火焰前取暖，眨着眼睛，欣喜若狂。水龙头被遗弃在孤独中，它的溢出物阴郁地凝固，变成了敌视人类的冰。商店的明亮，其中冬青枝和浆果在窗户的灯光中噼啪作响，使经过的人苍白的面容变得红润。禽肉商和杂货商的生意变成了一场精彩的玩笑：一场壮丽的游行，几乎无法相信这种乏味的原则如讨价还价和销售有任何关系。 伦敦市长在强大的市政厅要塞中，命令他的五十名厨师和管家按照市长府邸的传统庆祝圣诞节；甚至连之前周一因在街上醉酒和嗜血而被罚款五先令的小裁缝，也在他的阁楼里搅拌着明天的布丁，而他的瘦妻子和婴儿则出去买牛肉。<br><br><br><br>Foggier yet, and colder. Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good Saint Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit’s nose with a touch of such weather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he would have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose, gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs, stooped down at Scrooge’s keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol: but at the first sound of<br><br><br><br>“God bless you, merry gentleman! May nothing you dismay!”<br><br>上帝保佑你，快乐的绅士！愿你的日子无忧无虑！<br><br><br><br>Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action, that the singer fled in terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog and even more congenial frost.<br><br>斯克鲁奇用如此强烈的行动力抓住尺子，歌手吓得逃走，留下钥匙孔给雾气和更加宜人的霜。<br><br><br><br>At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant clerk in the Tank, who instantly snuffed his candle out, and put on his hat.<br><br>终于，关上账房的钟声响起。斯克鲁奇带着恶意从凳子上站起来，无声地承认了这个事实，让期待中的罐子里的职员立刻熄灭了蜡烛，戴上帽子。<br><br><br><br>“You’ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?” said Scrooge.<br><br>“我想你明天一整天都会想要吧？”斯克鲁奇说。<br><br><br><br>“If quite convenient, sir.”<br><br>“如果方便的话，先生。”<br><br><br><br>“It’s not convenient,” said Scrooge, “and it’s not fair. If I was to stop half-a-crown for it, you’d think yourself ill-used, I’ll be bound?”<br><br>“这不方便，”斯克鲁奇说，“这也不公平。如果我要为此付半克朗，你肯定会觉得自己受到了不公正的对待，我敢打赌？”<br><br><br><br>The clerk smiled faintly.<br><br>职员淡淡地笑了笑。<br><br><br><br>“And yet,” said Scrooge, “you don’t think me ill-used, when I pay a day’s wages for no work.”<br><br><br><br>The clerk observed that it was only once a year.<br><br>职员观察到这只是一年一次。<br><br><br><br>“A poor excuse for picking a man’s pocket every twenty-fifth of December!” said Scrooge, buttoning his great-coat to the chin. “But I suppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next morning.”<br><br>“每年 12 月 25 日偷人的借口太差了！”斯克鲁奇说着，把大衣扣到下巴处。“但我想你肯定得整个白天都有。明天早上早点来。”<br><br><br><br>The clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl. The office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends of his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no great-coat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blindman’s-buff.<br><br>职员答应了他；斯克鲁奇咆哮着走了出去。办公室瞬间关闭，职员（他没有大衣，因为他在炫耀他的白色舒适毯，毯子的长边垂到腰下）沿着一条小巷，在男孩们的滑梯上滑了二十次，以庆祝平安夜，然后尽可能快地跑回家，到坎登镇，玩起了捉迷藏。<br><br><br><br>Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and having read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening with his banker’s-book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had once belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of rooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little business to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run there when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other houses, and forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and dreary enough, for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms being all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge, who knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed as if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the threshold.<br><br>Scrooge 在他的惯常忧郁的小酒馆里吃了一顿忧郁的晚餐；读完了所有报纸，又用他的银行账簿消磨了剩下的夜晚，然后回家睡觉。他住在曾经属于他已故合伙人的房间里。这是一套阴暗的房间，在一座低矮的建筑群里，那里几乎没有生意，以至于人们几乎忍不住想象，当它还是一座年轻房子时，它一定是和其他房子玩捉迷藏，然后忘记了回家的路。现在它已经足够老了，足够凄凉了，除了 Scrooge 之外，没有人住在里面，其他房间都出租给了办公室。院子非常黑暗，即使是 Scrooge，连每块石头都知道，也不得不用手摸索。雾气和霜冻围绕着房子那扇黑色的古老大门，仿佛天气之神坐在门槛上沉思哀悼。<br><br><br><br>Now, it is a fact, that there was nothing at all particular about the knocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact, that Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence in that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy about him as any man in the city of London, even including—which is a bold word—the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley, since his last mention of his seven years’ dead partner that afternoon. And then let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge, having his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its undergoing any intermediate process of change—not a knocker, but Marley’s face.<br><br>现在，这是一个事实，门上的敲门声没有任何特别之处，只是非常大。这也是一个事实，斯克鲁奇在整个居住在那里的时间里，日夜都看到了它；还有，斯克鲁奇身上几乎没有所谓的幻想，他在伦敦城的任何人身上都很少见，包括——这是一个大胆的词——公司、市政官员和仆役。还要记住，自从那天下午提到他七年前去世的合伙人马尔利以来，斯克鲁奇就没有再想过他。那么，如果有人能解释给我听，斯克鲁奇在门锁里拿着钥匙，在敲门声中看到了马尔利的脸——不是敲门声，而是马尔利的脸——这是怎么发生的。<br><br><br><br>Marley’s face. It was not in impenetrable shadow as the other objects in the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in a dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as Marley used to look: with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air; and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless. That, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to be in spite of the face and beyond its control, rather than a part of its own expression.<br><br>马雷的脸。它不像院子里其他物体那样笼罩在不可穿透的阴影中，但周围笼罩着一种阴郁的光，就像一只坏掉的龙虾在黑暗的地窖里。它既不愤怒也不凶猛，而是像马雷过去看斯克鲁奇那样看着他：带着幽灵般的镜片，戴在它那幽灵般的额头上。头发奇怪地被吹动，仿佛被呼吸或热气吹动；尽管眼睛睁得很大，但它们完全不动。那，以及它那苍白的颜色，让它看起来很可怕；但它的恐怖似乎是在脸部之外，超出了它的控制，而不是它自己表情的一部分。<br><br><br><br>As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.<br><br>Scrooge 凝视着这一现象，那又是门环声。<br><br><br><br>To say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of a terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would be untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.<br><br>说他没有受到惊吓，或者说他的血液没有意识到一种从婴儿时期就陌生的可怕感觉，这是不真实的。但他还是把手放在他放弃的钥匙上，坚定地转动它，走了进去，并点燃了他的蜡烛。<br><br><br><br>He did pause, with a moment’s irresolution, before he shut the door; and he did look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to be terrified with the sight of Marley’s pigtail sticking out into the hall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws and nuts that held the knocker on, so he said “Pooh, pooh!” and closed it with a bang.<br><br>“然而，”斯克鲁奇说，“当我支付一天的工资而不要求任何工作的时候，你不会认为我受到了不公平的对待。” 在关上门之前，他停顿了一下，显得有些犹豫；他先小心翼翼地看了看门后，好像半期待着看到马雷的辫子从大厅里伸出来吓他一跳。但是门后除了固定门环的螺丝和螺母外，什么也没有，所以他发出“呸，呸！”的声音，砰地一声关上了门。<br><br><br><br>The sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above, and every cask in the wine-merchant’s cellars below, appeared to have a separate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall, and up the stairs; slowly too: trimming his candle as he went.<br><br>声音像雷鸣一样在屋内回荡。楼上每个房间，楼下酒商地窖中的每个酒桶，似乎都有自己的回声。斯克鲁奇不是会被回声吓到的人。他锁上了门，穿过大厅，走上楼梯；走得很慢，边走边修剪蜡烛。<br><br><br><br>You may talk vaguely about driving a coach-and-six up a good old flight of stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say you might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise, with the splinter-bar towards the wall and the door towards the balustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and room to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen gas-lamps out of the street wouldn’t have lighted the entry too well, so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge’s dip.<br><br>你可能模糊地谈论驾驶一辆马车和六匹马爬上一段好楼梯，或者穿过一个糟糕的年轻议会法案；但我的意思是，你可能已经把灵柩车开上了楼梯，宽敞地行驶，把有刺条的横杆朝向墙壁，车门朝向栏杆：而且做得轻松自如。那里有足够的宽度，还有富余的空间；这可能是 Scrooge 认为他在黑暗中看到一辆灵柩车在他前面行驶的原因。街上的六盏煤气灯不可能很好地照亮入口，所以你可以想象，Scrooge 的昏暗光线使得那里相当黑暗。<br><br><br><br>Up Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and Scrooge liked it. But before he shut his heavy door, he walked through his rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of the face to desire to do that.<br><br>斯克鲁奇径直走了，对那毫不在意。黑暗便宜，斯克鲁奇喜欢它。但在他关上沉重的大门之前，他穿过自己的房间，以确保一切正常。他对那张脸的记忆刚好足够，让他想要这么做。<br><br><br><br>Sitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under the table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and basin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his head) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two fish-baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.<br><br>客厅、卧室、储藏室。一切如常。桌子下无人，沙发上无人；壁炉里有一小堆火；勺子和盆子都已准备好；还有一锅粥（斯克鲁奇头有点冷）放在炉子上。床下无人；衣柜里无人；他的睡袍挂在墙上，姿态可疑。储藏室一如既往。旧火警、旧鞋、两个鱼篮、三脚洗漱台，还有一根拨火棍。<br><br><br><br>Quite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double-locked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against surprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers, and his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.<br><br>他非常满意，关上了门，把自己锁在里面；双重锁，这不是他的习惯。这样，他就可以避免意外，脱下领带；穿上睡袍和拖鞋，戴上睡帽；坐在火炉前喝粥。<br><br><br><br>It was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was obliged to sit close to it, and brood over it, before he could extract the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel. The fireplace was an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and paved all round with quaint Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures. There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh’s daughters; Queens of Sheba, Angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like feather-beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in butter-boats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts; and yet that face of Marley, seven years dead, came like the ancient Prophet’s rod, and swallowed up the whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at first, with power to shape some picture on its surface from the disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of old Marley’s head on every one.<br><br>确实火势很小；在这样的寒冷夜晚，什么都没有。他不得不坐在火炉旁边，沉思着，才能从这么一小堆燃料中感受到一丝温暖。壁炉是古老的，由一位荷兰商人很久以前建造的，周围铺满了古怪荷兰瓷砖，旨在描绘圣经故事。有该隐和亚伯，法老的女儿们；示巴女王，天使使者像羽毛床一样在空中穿过云层，亚伯拉罕，伯沙撒，使徒们乘坐黄油船出海，数百个形象吸引他的思绪；然而，马雷的脸，已经死去七年，就像古代先知的魔杖一样，吞噬了所有。如果每一块光滑的瓷砖最初都是一片空白，能够从他的思想的碎片中塑造出一些画面，那么每个上面都会有一张老马雷的头像。<br><br><br><br>“Humbug!” said Scrooge; and walked across the room.<br><br>“胡说！”斯克鲁奇说；然后穿过房间。<br><br><br><br>After several turns, he sat down again. As he threw his head back in the chair, his glance happened to rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that hung in the room, and communicated for some purpose now forgotten with a chamber in the highest story of the building. It was with great astonishment, and with a strange, inexplicable dread, that as he looked, he saw this bell begin to swing. It swung so softly in the outset that it scarcely made a sound; but soon it rang out loudly, and so did every bell in the house.<br><br>几经周转，他又坐了下来。当他把头向后靠在椅子上时，他的目光偶然落在了一个铃铛上，一个不再使用的铃铛，它悬挂在房间里，现在为了某种已经遗忘的目的，与建筑最高层的房间相连。当他看着时，他惊讶地发现这个铃铛开始摇摆。一开始摇摆得很轻，几乎听不到声音；但很快，它就响亮地响了起来，屋里的每个铃铛也都如此。<br><br><br><br>This might have lasted half a minute, or a minute, but it seemed an hour. The bells ceased as they had begun, together. They were succeeded by a clanking noise, deep down below; as if some person were dragging a heavy chain over the casks in the wine-merchant’s cellar. Scrooge then remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as dragging chains.<br><br><br><br>The cellar-door flew open with a booming sound, and then he heard the noise much louder, on the floors below; then coming up the stairs; then coming straight towards his door.<br><br>这可能持续了半分钟或一分钟，但感觉像是一个小时。铃铛像开始时一样同时停止了。随后，下面传来一阵叮当声；仿佛有人在酒商地窖里拖着一条沉重的链条。这时，斯克鲁奇突然想起，他曾听说闹鬼的房子里的鬼魂被描述为拖着链条。 地窖门砰地一声飞开，然后他听到下面的声音更大了；然后声音从楼梯上传来；然后直奔他的门口。<br><br><br><br>“It’s humbug still!” said Scrooge. “I won’t believe it.”<br><br>“这还是胡说八道！”斯克鲁奇说。“我不会相信的。”<br><br><br><br>His colour changed though, when, without a pause, it came on through the heavy door, and passed into the room before his eyes. Upon its coming in, the dying flame leaped up, as though it cried, “I know him; Marley’s Ghost!” and fell again.<br><br>他的脸色变了，当它毫无停顿地穿过厚重的门，进入他的视线中的房间时。就在它进来的时候，即将熄灭的火焰跃起，仿佛在喊叫，“我认识他；马雷的鬼魂！”然后又落了下来。<br><br><br><br>Marley’s Ghost The same face: the very same. Marley in his pigtail, usual waistcoat, tights and boots; the tassels on the latter bristling, like his pigtail, and his coat-skirts, and the hair upon his head. The chain he drew was clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound about him like a tail; and it was made (for Scrooge observed it closely) of cash-boxes, keys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel. His body was transparent; so that Scrooge, observing him, and looking through his waistcoat, could see the two buttons on his coat behind.<br><br>马雷的鬼魂 同样的面孔：完全一样。马雷戴着辫子，穿着通常的背心，紧身裤和靴子；靴子的流苏像他的辫子一样竖立，还有他的外套裙摆和头上的头发。他拉出的链子绕在他的腰间。它很长，像尾巴一样缠绕着他；而且（斯克鲁奇仔细观察后）是由现金箱、钥匙、挂锁、账本、契约和铸铁重钱包制成的。他的身体是透明的；所以斯克鲁奇观察他，透过他的背心，可以看到他外套后面的两个纽扣。<br><br><br><br>Scrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels, but he had never believed it until now.<br><br>Scrooge 常常听说 Marley 没有同情心，但他直到现在才相信。不，即使现在他也不相信。尽管他从头到尾看透了那个幽灵，看到它站在他面前；尽管他感受到了它那冰冷眼睛的寒意；并且注意到了它头上和下巴上那块叠好的围巾的质地，这块围巾他以前从未注意到；他仍然怀疑，与自己的感官抗争。<br><br><br><br>No, nor did he believe it even now. Though he looked the phantom through and through, and saw it standing before him; though he felt the chilling influence of its death-cold eyes; and marked the very texture of the folded kerchief bound about its head and chin, which wrapper he had not observed before; he was still incredulous, and fought against his senses.<br><br><br><br>“How now!” said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever. “What do you want with me?”<br><br>“现在怎么了！”Scrooge 冷嘲热讽地说，“你找我有什么事？”<br><br><br><br>“Much!”—Marley’s voice, no doubt about it.<br><br>“很多！”——毫无疑问是马雷的声音。<br><br><br><br>“Who are you?” “你是谁？”<br><br><br><br>“Ask me who I was .”<br><br>“问我我是谁。”<br><br><br><br>“Who were you then?” said Scrooge, raising his voice. “You’re particular, for a shade.” He was going to say “ to a shade,” but substituted this, as more appropriate.<br><br>“那你当时是谁？”斯克鲁奇提高声音说。“对于一个鬼魂来说，你太挑剔了。”他本想说“对于一个鬼魂来说”，但觉得这个说法更合适。<br><br><br><br>“In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.”<br><br>“在生前，我是你的合伙人，雅各布·马利。”<br><br><br><br>“Can you—can you sit down?” asked Scrooge, looking doubtfully at him.<br><br>“你能——你能坐下吗？”斯克鲁奇怀疑地看着他问道。<br><br><br><br>“I can.” “我能。”<br><br><br><br>“Do it, then.” “那就做吧。”<br><br><br><br>Scrooge asked the question, because he didn’t know whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair; and felt that in the event of its being impossible, it might involve the necessity of an embarrassing explanation. But the ghost sat down on the opposite side of the fireplace, as if he were quite used to it.<br><br>斯克鲁奇问这个问题，因为他不知道这样一个透明的鬼魂是否能够坐下来；他觉得如果不可能，可能需要尴尬的解释。但鬼魂坐在壁炉的另一边，好像他对此已经习以为常了。<br><br><br><br>“You don’t believe in me,” observed the Ghost.<br><br>“你不相信我，”幽灵观察道。<br><br><br><br>“I don’t,” said Scrooge. “我不相信，”斯克鲁奇说。<br><br><br><br>“What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your senses?”<br><br>“你有什么证据能证明我的存在超出了你的感官之外？”<br><br><br><br>“I don’t know,” said Scrooge.<br><br>我不知道，”斯克鲁奇说。<br><br><br><br>“Why do you doubt your senses?”<br><br>“你为什么怀疑你的感官？”<br><br><br><br>“Because,” said Scrooge, “a little thing affects them. A slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats. You may be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato. There’s more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!”<br><br>“因为，”斯克鲁奇说，“一点小事就会影响它们。轻微的胃部不适会使它们欺骗你。你可能是一块未消化的牛肉，一个芥末污点，一片奶酪屑，一块半熟的土豆碎片。你身上更多的是肉汁而不是坟墓，无论你是什么！”<br><br><br><br>Scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he feel, in his heart, by any means waggish then. The truth is, that he tried to be smart, as a means of distracting his own attention, and keeping down his terror; for the spectre’s voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones.<br><br>Scrooge 并不擅长讲笑话，当时他内心也绝不是那种爱开玩笑的人。事实上，他试图表现得聪明，以此来转移自己的注意力，减轻恐惧；因为幽灵的声音让他骨髓都感到震动。<br><br><br><br>To sit, staring at those fixed glazed eyes, in silence for a moment, would play, Scrooge felt, the very deuce with him. There was something very awful, too, in the spectre’s being provided with an infernal atmosphere of its own. Scrooge could not feel it himself, but this was clearly the case; for though the Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its hair, and skirts, and tassels, were still agitated as by the hot vapour from an oven.<br><br><br><br>“You see this toothpick?” said Scrooge, returning quickly to the charge, for the reason just assigned; and wishing, though it were only for a second, to divert the vision’s stony gaze from himself.<br><br>Scrooge 觉得，静静地坐着，盯着那些固定的、呆滞的眼睛，那一刻对他来说简直就是折磨。幽灵周围还弥漫着一种非常可怕的气息。Scrooge 自己感觉不到，但情况显然如此；尽管幽灵坐得一动不动，但它的头发、裙子和流苏仍然像被烤箱热气吹动一样摇曳。 “你看到这根牙签了吗？”Scrooge 迅速回到话题上，原因如前所述；并且希望，哪怕只是一瞬间，也能将那石像般的目光从自己身上移开。<br><br><br><br>“I do,” replied the Ghost.<br><br>“我做到了，”幽灵回答道。<br><br><br><br>“You are not looking at it,” said Scrooge.<br><br>“你没有在看着它，”斯克鲁奇说。<br><br><br><br>“But I see it,” said the Ghost, “notwithstanding.”<br><br>“但我看到了，”幽灵说，“尽管如此。”<br><br><br><br>“Well!” returned Scrooge, “I have but to swallow this, and be for the rest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins, all of my own creation. Humbug, I tell you! humbug!”<br><br><br><br>At this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook its chain with such a dismal and appalling noise, that Scrooge held on tight to his chair, to save himself from falling in a swoon. But how much greater was his horror, when the phantom taking off the bandage round its head, as if it were too warm to wear indoors, its lower jaw dropped down upon its breast!<br><br><br><br>Scrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands before his face.<br><br><br><br>“Mercy!” he said. “Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?”<br><br>“慈悲！”他说，“可怕的幻影，你为什么要打扰我？”<br><br><br><br>“Man of the worldly mind!” replied the Ghost, “do you believe in me or not?”<br><br>“世故之人！”鬼魂回答，“你相信我吗？”<br><br><br><br>“I do,” said Scrooge. “I must. But why do spirits walk the earth, and why do they come to me?”<br><br>“我相信，”斯克鲁奇说，“我必须相信。但为什么灵魂要在这世上行走，为什么它们要来找我？”<br><br><br><br>“It is required of every man,” the Ghost returned, “that the spirit within him should walk abroad among his fellowmen, and travel far and wide; and if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do so after death. It is doomed to wander through the world—oh, woe is me!—and witness what it cannot share, but might have shared on earth, and turned to happiness!”<br><br>“每个男人都必须做到，”鬼魂回答道，“他内心的精神应在世人之间行走，远行四方；如果那精神在生命中不外出，它将在死后受到惩罚。它注定要在世间漂泊——哦，我的天哪！——目睹它无法分享，但在人间本可以分享，并转化为幸福的事情！”<br><br><br><br>Again the spectre raised a cry, and shook its chain and wrung its shadowy hands.<br><br><br><br>“You are fettered,” said Scrooge, trembling. “Tell me why?”<br><br>鬼魂再次发出一声尖叫，摇动它的锁链，扭动它那阴影般的手。 “你被束缚了，”斯克鲁奇颤抖着说。“告诉我为什么？”<br><br><br><br>“I wear the chain I forged in life,” replied the Ghost. “I made it link by link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of my own free will, and of my own free will I wore it. Is its pattern strange to you? ”<br><br>“我戴着我在生活中锻造的锁链，”鬼魂回答道。“我是把它一环一环、一码一码地编织起来的；是我自愿地把它系在身上，也是自愿地戴着它。它的图案对你来说奇怪吗？”<br><br><br><br>Scrooge trembled more and more.<br><br><br><br>“Or would you know,” pursued the Ghost, “the weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself? It was full as heavy and as long as this, seven Christmas Eves ago. You have laboured on it, since. It is a ponderous chain!”<br><br><br><br>Scrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable: but he could see nothing.<br><br>Scrooge 在地上四处张望，期待着发现自己被五十或六十英寻的铁缆包围：但他什么也没看到。<br><br><br><br>“Jacob,” he said, imploringly. “Old Jacob Marley, tell me more. Speak comfort to me, Jacob!”<br><br>“Jacob，”他恳求道。“老 Jacob Marley，告诉我更多。Jacob，安慰我！”<br><br><br><br>“I have none to give,” the Ghost replied. “It comes from other regions, Ebenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed by other ministers, to other kinds of men. Nor can I tell you what I would. A very little more is all permitted to me. I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I cannot linger anywhere. My spirit never walked beyond our counting-house—mark me!—in life my spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money-changing hole; and weary journeys lie before me!”<br><br>“我没有什么可以给予的，”鬼魂回答。“它来自其他地区，Ebenezer Scrooge，由其他使者传达给其他种类的人。我也无法告诉你我想知道什么。我允许知道的一切都很有限。我无法休息，我无法停留，我无法在任何地方逗留。我的灵魂从未在我们的账房之外走过——记住！——在我生前，我的灵魂从未超出我们货币兑换处的狭窄范围；前方还有漫长的旅程！”<br><br><br><br>It was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became thoughtful, to put his hands in his breeches pockets. Pondering on what the Ghost had said, he did so now, but without lifting up his eyes, or getting off his knees.<br><br>斯克鲁奇一陷入沉思，就会习惯性地把手放进裤兜。他现在正沉思着幽灵所说的话，就这样做了，但并没有抬起眼睛，也没有离开膝盖。<br><br><br><br>“You must have been very slow about it, Jacob,” Scrooge observed, in a business-like manner, though with humility and deference.<br><br><br><br>“Slow!” the Ghost repeated.<br><br>“你在这方面一定很慢，雅各布，”斯克鲁奇以一副公事公办的语气说道，尽管态度谦卑，充满敬意。 “慢！”幽灵重复道。<br><br><br><br>“Seven years dead,” mused Scrooge. “And travelling all the time!”<br><br>“死了七年了，”斯克鲁奇沉思道。“一直都在旅行！”<br><br><br><br>“The whole time,” said the Ghost. “No rest, no peace. Incessant torture of remorse.”<br><br>“一直都在，”幽灵说。“没有休息，没有安宁。无尽的悔恨折磨。”<br><br><br><br>“You travel fast?” said Scrooge.<br><br>“你旅行得很快吗？”斯克鲁奇问。<br><br><br><br>“On the wings of the wind,” replied the Ghost.<br><br>“随风飘荡，”鬼魂回答道。<br><br><br><br>“You might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years,” said Scrooge.<br><br>“在七年的时间里，你可能已经跨越了大量的土地，”斯克鲁奇说。<br><br><br><br>The Ghost, on hearing this, set up another cry, and clanked its chain so hideously in the dead silence of the night, that the Ward would have been justified in indicting it for a nuisance.<br><br>听到这话，鬼魂又发出一声尖叫，在夜间的寂静中，它的锁链发出可怕的响声，以至于如果有人控告它为滋扰， ward（地区）会是有理由的。<br><br><br><br>“Oh! captive, bound, and double-ironed,” cried the phantom, “not to know, that ages of incessant labour by immortal creatures, for this earth must pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is all developed. Not to know that any Christian spirit working kindly in its little sphere, whatever it may be, will find its mortal life too short for its vast means of usefulness. Not to know that no space of regret can make amends for one life’s opportunity misused! Yet such was I! Oh! such was I!”<br><br>“哦！被囚禁的，被束缚的，被双重铁链锁住的，”幽灵喊道，“不知道，由不朽的生物们无尽的劳动，为了这个地球，必须经过永恒，才能使它所具有的善得到完全的发展。不知道，任何在其小小领域内行善的基督教精神，无论它是什么，都会发现自己有限的生命对于其巨大的有用性来说太短暂了。不知道，任何遗憾的空间都无法弥补一个生命机会的浪费！然而，我就是这样的！哦！我就是这样的！”<br><br><br><br>“But you were always a good man of business, Jacob,” faltered Scrooge, who now began to apply this to himself.<br><br>“但是，雅各，你一直是个优秀的商人，”斯克鲁奇结结巴巴地说，现在他开始把这话应用到他自己身上。<br><br><br><br>“Business!” cried the Ghost, wringing its hands again. “Mankind was my business. The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance, and benevolence, were, all, my business. The dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business!”<br><br>“商业！”幽灵又喊道，再次拧着双手，“人类的福祉是我的事业。公共福利是我的事业；慈善、仁慈、宽容和仁爱，都是我的事业。我的贸易只是我广阔事业海洋中的一滴水分！”<br><br><br><br>It held up its chain at arm’s length, as if that were the cause of all its unavailing grief, and flung it heavily upon the ground again.<br><br>它将链条举到手臂的长度，仿佛那是它所有徒劳悲伤的原因，然后重重地把它扔到地上。<br><br><br><br>“At this time of the rolling year,” the spectre said, “I suffer most. Why did I walk through crowds of fellow-beings with my eyes turned down, and never raise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise Men to a poor abode! Were there no poor homes to which its light would have conducted me! ”<br><br>“在这年轮滚滚的时刻，”幽灵说，“我感到最痛苦。我为什么要在人群中低头行走，从不抬头仰望那颗引导智者们来到贫穷住所的幸运之星！难道没有贫穷的家庭，它的光芒会引导我吗！”<br><br><br><br>Scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this rate, and began to quake exceedingly.<br><br>听到幽灵这样继续说，斯克鲁奇非常惊慌，开始极度颤抖。<br><br><br><br>“Hear me!” cried the Ghost. “My time is nearly gone.”<br><br>“听我说！”鬼魂喊道。“我的时间快到了。”<br><br><br><br>“I will,” said Scrooge. “But don’t be hard upon me! Don’t be flowery, Jacob! Pray!”<br><br>“我会的，”斯克鲁奇说。“但别对我太苛刻！别那么华丽，雅各！求你了！”<br><br><br><br>“How it is that I appear before you in a shape that you can see, I may not tell. I have sat invisible beside you many and many a day.”<br><br>“我怎么会以你们能看见的样子出现在你们面前，我无法告诉你。我许多天都坐在你们身边，隐形地。”<br><br><br><br>It was not an agreeable idea. Scrooge shivered, and wiped the perspiration from his brow.<br><br>这不是一个令人愉快的主意。斯克鲁奇打了个寒颤，擦去额头上的汗水。<br><br><br><br>“That is no light part of my penance,” pursued the Ghost. “I am here to-night to warn you, that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate. A chance and hope of my procuring, Ebenezer.”<br><br>“这并不是我惩罚的轻描淡写部分，”鬼魂继续说。“我今晚来是为了警告你，你还有机会和希望逃离我的命运。一个机会和希望，是我为你争取的，伊万·泽泽。”<br><br><br><br>“You were always a good friend to me,” said Scrooge. “Thank’ee!”<br><br>“你一直是我很好的朋友，”斯克鲁奇说。“谢谢你！”<br><br><br><br>“You will be haunted,” resumed the Ghost, “by Three Spirits.”<br><br>“你将受到三魂的困扰，”鬼魂继续说，“Three Spirits。”<br><br><br><br>Scrooge’s countenance fell almost as low as the Ghost’s had done.<br><br><br><br>“Is that the chance and hope you mentioned, Jacob?” he demanded, in a faltering voice.<br><br>斯克鲁奇的面容几乎低到了鬼魂的水平。 “这就是你提到的机会和希望吗，雅各布？”他带着颤抖的声音质问道。<br><br><br><br>“It is.” 它是。<br><br><br><br>“I—I think I’d rather not,” said Scrooge.<br><br>“我——我想我还是不愿意，”斯克鲁奇说。<br><br><br><br>“Without their visits,” said the Ghost, “you cannot hope to shun the path I tread. Expect the first to-morrow, when the bell tolls One.”<br><br>“没有他们的拜访，”鬼魂说，“你无法希望避开我走过的路。明天当钟声敲响一点时，期待第一个。”<br><br><br><br>“Couldn’t I take ’em all at once, and have it over, Jacob?” hinted Scrooge.<br><br>“我能不能一次带他们全部来，这样就结束了，雅各布？”斯克鲁奇暗示道。<br><br><br><br>“Expect the second on the next night at the same hour. The third upon the next night when the last stroke of Twelve has ceased to vibrate. Look to see me no more; and look that, for your own sake, you remember what has passed between us!”<br><br>“第二天同一时间，期待第二个。第三天在午夜最后一击停止振动时。别再看到我了；并且为了你自己的缘故，记住我们之间所发生的一切！”<br><br><br><br>When it had said these words, the spectre took its wrapper from the table, and bound it round its head, as before. Scrooge knew this, by the smart sound its teeth made, when the jaws were brought together by the bandage. He ventured to raise his eyes again, and found his supernatural visitor confronting him in an erect attitude, with its chain wound over and about its arm.<br><br>当它说完这些话后，那个幽灵从桌子上拿起它的外套，像以前一样把它围在头上。斯克鲁奇通过它牙齿咬合时发出的清脆声音知道这一点，当绷带将下巴绑在一起时。他鼓起勇气再次抬起眼睛，发现他的超自然访客以一种笔直的姿态面对着他，它的链条绕过并缠绕在它的手臂上。<br><br><br><br>The apparition walked backward from him; and at every step it took, the window raised itself a little, so that when the spectre reached it, it was wide open.<br><br><br><br>It beckoned Scrooge to approach, which he did. When they were within two paces of each other, Marley’s Ghost held up its hand, warning him to come no nearer. Scrooge stopped.<br><br>幻影从他身边向后走去；每走一步，窗户都会稍微打开一点，所以当幽灵到达时，窗户已经完全敞开。 它示意斯克鲁奇走近，斯克鲁奇照做了。当他们相距两步之遥时，马雷的幽灵举起手，警告他不要再靠近。斯克鲁奇停下了。<br><br><br><br>Not so much in obedience, as in surprise and fear: for on the raising of the hand, he became sensible of confused noises in the air; incoherent sounds of lamentation and regret; wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and self-accusatory. The spectre, after listening for a moment, joined in the mournful dirge; and floated out upon the bleak, dark night.<br><br>不太是出于服从，而是出于惊讶和恐惧：因为当他举起手时，他感到了空气中混乱的声音；不连贯的哀悼和后悔的声音；无法言喻的悲伤和自责的哭声。幽灵在听了片刻之后，加入了悲伤的挽歌；然后在荒凉、黑暗的夜晚中飘浮出去。<br><br><br><br>Scrooge followed to the window: desperate in his curiosity. He looked out.<br><br><br><br>The air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and thither in restless haste, and moaning as they went. Every one of them wore chains like Marley’s Ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments) were linked together; none were free. Many had been personally known to Scrooge in their lives. He had been quite familiar with one old ghost, in a white waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle, who cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an infant, whom it saw below, upon a door-step. The misery with them all was, clearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in human matters, and had lost the power for ever.<br><br>斯克鲁奇跟随着走到窗前：他的好奇心极度迫切。他向外望去。 空气中充满了幽灵，它们在不安的匆忙中四处游荡，边走边呻吟。他们每个人都戴着像马雷幽灵一样的锁链；其中一些（可能是有罪的政府）被锁在一起；没有人是自由的。许多人在斯克鲁奇生前都曾亲自认识。他曾经非常熟悉一个穿着白色背心、脚踝上附着一个巨大的铁保险箱的老幽灵，它因为无法帮助一个带着婴儿的可怜女人而痛苦地哭泣，这个女人就在下面的门口台阶上。显然，他们共同的痛苦是，他们试图在人类事务中做好事，却永远失去了这种力量。<br><br><br><br>Ghosts of Departed Usurers Whether these creatures faded into mist, or mist enshrouded them, he could not tell. But they and their spirit voices faded together; and the night became as it had been when he walked home.<br><br><br><br>Scrooge closed the window, and examined the door by which the Ghost had entered. It was double-locked, as he had locked it with his own hands, and the bolts were undisturbed. He tried to say “Humbug!” but stopped at the first syllable. And being, from the emotion he had undergone, or the fatigues of the day, or his glimpse of the Invisible World, or the dull conversation of the Ghost, or the lateness of the hour, much in need of repose; went straight to bed, without undressing, and fell asleep upon the instant.<br><br>斯克鲁奇关上了窗户，检查了幽灵进入的门。门像他亲手锁上时一样，双重上锁，门闩完好无损。他试图说“胡说！”但只说出了第一个音节。由于他经历了强烈的情感，或是白天的疲劳，或是他对无形世界的瞥见，或是幽灵那乏味的谈话，或是时间的晚晚，他非常需要休息；于是他直接上床，没有脱衣服，立刻就睡着了。<br><br><br><br>STAVE TWO. THE FIRST OF THE THREE SPIRITS. When Scrooge awoke, it was so dark, that looking out of bed, he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his chamber. He was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes, when the chimes of a neighbouring church struck the four quarters. So he listened for the hour.<br><br><br><br>To his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from six to seven, and from seven to eight, and regularly up to twelve; then stopped. Twelve! It was past two when he went to bed. The clock was wrong. An icicle must have got into the works. Twelve!<br><br><br><br>He touched the spring of his repeater, to correct this most preposterous clock. Its rapid little pulse beat twelve: and stopped.<br><br>他触摸了计时表的发条，以纠正这个荒谬的钟。它快速的小脉搏敲响了十二下，然后停止了。<br><br><br><br>“Why, it isn’t possible,” said Scrooge, “that I can have slept through a whole day and far into another night. It isn’t possible that anything has happened to the sun, and this is twelve at noon!”<br><br>“哎呀，不可能，”斯克鲁奇说，“我怎么能睡了一整天，还深入到另一个夜晚。不可能太阳出了什么事，现在是中午十二点！”<br><br><br><br>The idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed, and groped his way to the window. He was obliged to rub the frost off with the sleeve of his dressing-gown before he could see anything; and could see very little then. All he could make out was, that it was still very foggy and extremely cold, and that there was no noise of people running to and fro, and making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have been if night had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the world. This was a great relief, because “three days after sight of this First of Exchange pay to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge or his order,” and so forth, would have become a mere United States’ security if there were no days to count by.<br><br>这个想法令人惊恐，他急忙从床上爬起来，摸索着走到窗前。在他能看见任何东西之前，他不得不用手套擦去霜；那时他看得也很少。他能看清楚的只是，雾仍然很浓，非常冷，而且没有人们来回奔跑和制造很大骚动的声音，如果夜晚打败了明亮的日子，占据了这个世界，毫无疑问会有这样的声音。这让他松了一口气，因为“在看到这张汇票的第一天后的三天内支付给埃比尼泽·斯克鲁奇先生或其指定人”，等等，如果没有天数可以计算，那就成了仅仅是一张美国证券。<br><br><br><br>Scrooge went to bed again, and thought, and thought, and thought it over and over and over, and could make nothing of it. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was; and the more he endeavoured not to think, the more he thought.<br><br>Scrooge 再次上床睡觉，思考，思考，反复思考，却无法理解。他越思考，就越困惑；他越努力不去思考，就越思考。<br><br><br><br>Marley’s Ghost bothered him exceedingly. Every time he resolved within himself, after mature inquiry, that it was all a dream, his mind flew back again, like a strong spring released, to its first position, and presented the same problem to be worked all through, “Was it a dream or not?”<br><br><br><br>Scrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters more, when he remembered, on a sudden, that the Ghost had warned him of a visitation when the bell tolled one. He resolved to lie awake until the hour was passed; and, considering that he could no more go to sleep than go to Heaven, this was perhaps the wisest resolution in his power.<br><br>Marley 的鬼魂让他极度烦恼。每次他经过深思熟虑后，决定这一切都是一场梦，他的思绪就像被释放的强弹簧一样，又回到了最初的位置，提出了同样的问题，需要从头到尾解决，“这是梦还是不是？” Scrooge 就这样躺在这状态中，直到钟声响了四分之三，他突然想起鬼魂曾警告他，当钟声敲响一次时会有拜访。他决定醒着躺到这个小时过去；考虑到他无法入睡就像无法上天堂一样，这可能是他所能做出的最明智的决定。<br><br><br><br>The quarter was so long, that he was more than once convinced he must have sunk into a doze unconsciously, and missed the clock. At length it broke upon his listening ear.<br><br>这个季度如此漫长，他不止一次确信自己不知不觉地陷入了昏睡，错过了时钟。最后，他听到了那声音。<br><br><br><br>“Ding, dong!” 叮咚！<br><br><br><br>“A quarter past,” said Scrooge, counting.<br><br>“一刻过半，”斯克鲁奇数着说。<br><br><br><br>“Ding, dong!” 叮咚！<br><br><br><br>“Half-past!” said Scrooge.<br><br>“半点了！”斯克鲁奇说。<br><br><br><br>“Ding, dong!” 叮咚！<br><br><br><br>“A quarter to it,” said Scrooge.<br><br>“差一刻了，”斯克鲁奇说。<br><br><br><br>“Ding, dong!” 叮咚！<br><br><br><br>“The hour itself,” said Scrooge, triumphantly, “and nothing else!”<br><br>“这个小时本身，”斯克鲁奇得意洋洋地说，“别的什么都不算！”<br><br><br><br>He spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with a deep, dull, hollow, melancholy One. Light flashed up in the room upon the instant, and the curtains of his bed were drawn.<br><br>他说话时，钟声还未响起，而现在它却以深沉、沉闷、空洞、忧郁的钟声响起。灯光瞬间照亮了房间，他的床帘被拉开。<br><br><br><br>The curtains of his bed were drawn aside, I tell you, by a hand. Not the curtains at his feet, nor the curtains at his back, but those to which his face was addressed. The curtains of his bed were drawn aside; and Scrooge, starting up into a half-recumbent attitude, found himself face to face with the unearthly visitor who drew them: as close to it as I am now to you, and I am standing in the spirit at your elbow.<br><br>我告诉你，是他的手拉开床帘的，不是脚边的床帘，也不是背后的床帘，而是面向他脸的床帘。床帘被拉开；斯克鲁奇突然坐起身，发现自己正面对着拉开床帘的不凡访客：就像我现在离你这么近，而我正站在你的肘边，以灵体的形式。<br><br><br><br>It was a strange figure—like a child: yet not so like a child as like an old man, viewed through some supernatural medium, which gave him the appearance of having receded from the view, and being diminished to a child’s proportions. Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its back, was white as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms were very long and muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold were of uncommon strength. Its legs and feet, most delicately formed, were, like those upper members, bare. It wore a tunic of the purest white; and round its waist was bound a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful. It held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and, in singular contradiction of that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed with summer flowers. But the strangest thing about it was, that from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear jet of light, by which all this was visible; and which was doubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a great extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under its arm.<br><br>这是一个奇怪的形状——像孩子：但又不像孩子，更像一个老人，通过某种超自然的方式观察，他看起来像是退出了视线，缩小到了孩子的尺寸。它的头发，垂在脖子和背上，像年龄一样白；然而，脸上没有一丝皱纹，皮肤上有着最温柔的色泽。手臂非常长且肌肉发达；手也是如此，仿佛它的握力非常强大。它的腿和脚，最精致地形成，就像那些上肢一样，裸露着。它穿着一件最纯白的长袍；腰间系着一条闪亮的腰带，其光泽非常美丽。它手里拿着一枝新鲜的冬青枝；然而，与那个冬日象征的奇特矛盾，它的衣服上装饰着夏天的花朵。但最奇怪的是，从它的头顶上发出一道明亮清澈的光芒，通过这光芒，所有这一切都可见；这无疑也是它在其昏暗时刻使用一个巨大的灭火器作为帽子，现在它把它夹在腋下的原因。<br><br><br><br>Even this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing steadiness, was not its strangest quality. For as its belt sparkled and glittered now in one part and now in another, and what was light one instant, at another time was dark, so the figure itself fluctuated in its distinctness: being now a thing with one arm, now with one leg, now with twenty legs, now a pair of legs without a head, now a head without a body: of which dissolving parts, no outline would be visible in the dense gloom wherein they melted away. And in the very wonder of this, it would be itself again; distinct and clear as ever.<br><br>即使如此，当斯克鲁奇越来越稳定地注视它时，这也不是它最奇怪的品质。因为当它的腰带现在在这部分闪耀，现在在那部分闪耀，一秒钟是亮的，另一秒钟是暗的，所以这个形象本身在清晰度上波动：现在是一只手臂，现在是一只腿，现在有二十条腿，现在是一对没有头的腿，现在是一个没有身体的头：在这些溶解的部分中，在它们消融的浓暗中，没有任何轮廓是可见的。就在对这个奇迹的惊奇中，它又变成了自己；和以前一样清晰和明确。<br><br><br><br>“Are you the Spirit, sir, whose coming was foretold to me?” asked Scrooge.<br><br>“你是那个预言给我来的人的灵吗？”斯克鲁奇问道。<br><br><br><br>“I am!” “我是！”<br><br><br><br>The voice was soft and gentle. Singularly low, as if instead of being so close beside him, it were at a distance.<br><br>声音柔和而温柔。特别低沉，仿佛不是在他身边这么近，而是在一段距离之外。<br><br><br><br>“Who, and what are you?” Scrooge demanded.<br><br>“你是谁？你是什么？”斯克鲁奇问道。<br><br><br><br>“I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.”<br><br>“我是圣诞过去的幽灵。”<br><br><br><br>“Long Past?” inquired Scrooge: observant of its dwarfish stature.<br><br>“很久了吗？”斯克鲁奇问道：他注意到了他的矮小身材。<br><br><br><br>“No. Your past.” “不。你的过去。”<br><br><br><br>Perhaps, Scrooge could not have told anybody why, if anybody could have asked him; but he had a special desire to see the Spirit in his cap; and begged him to be covered.<br><br>或许，如果有人问他，斯克鲁奇也无法解释原因；但他特别想看到他帽子里的精灵；并请求他遮盖起来。<br><br><br><br>“What!” exclaimed the Ghost, “would you so soon put out, with worldly hands, the light I give? Is it not enough that you are one of those whose passions made this cap, and force me through whole trains of years to wear it low upon my brow!”<br><br>“什么！”鬼魂大声说道，“你竟如此迫不及待地用世俗之手熄灭我给予的光明？难道对你来说，仅仅因为你是那些因激情而戴这顶帽子的人之一，就足够了吗？让我在漫长的岁月里被迫低垂着它在我额头上！”<br><br><br><br>Scrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend or any knowledge of having wilfully “bonneted” the Spirit at any period of his life. He then made bold to inquire what business brought him there.<br><br>斯克鲁奇虔诚地否认了任何冒犯的意图，也否认了自己在任何时期有意“戴”过这个精灵。然后他大胆地询问是什么事务让他来到这里。<br><br><br><br>“Your welfare!” said the Ghost.<br><br>“你的福祉！”鬼魂说。<br><br><br><br>Scrooge expressed himself much obliged, but could not help thinking that a night of unbroken rest would have been more conducive to that end. The Spirit must have heard him thinking, for it said immediately:<br><br>Scrooge 表示非常感激，但忍不住想，一个连续的夜晚的休息会更有利于那个目的。精灵一定听到了他在想什么，因为它立刻说：<br><br><br><br>“Your reclamation, then. Take heed!”<br><br><br><br>It put out its strong hand as it spoke, and clasped him gently by the arm.<br><br>“那么，你的改造。小心！” 它在说话时伸出了强壮的手，轻轻地握住了他的手臂。<br><br><br><br>“Rise! and walk with me!”<br><br>“起来！跟我走！”<br><br><br><br>It would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the weather and the hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes; that bed was warm, and the thermometer a long way below freezing; that he was clad but lightly in his slippers, dressing-gown, and nightcap; and that he had a cold upon him at that time. The grasp, though gentle as a woman’s hand, was not to be resisted. He rose: but finding that the Spirit made towards the window, clasped his robe in supplication.<br><br>如果斯克鲁奇哀求说天气和时间不适合步行，那将是徒劳的；那张床很暖和，温度计的读数远低于冰点；他只穿着拖鞋、浴袍和睡帽，穿得很少；而且那时他正在感冒。尽管那手掌握得很温柔，就像女人的手一样，但无法抗拒。他站了起来：但发现精灵正朝窗户走去，他紧紧抓住长袍，表示恳求。<br><br><br><br>“I am a mortal,” Scrooge remonstrated, “and liable to fall.”<br><br>“我是一个凡人，”斯克鲁奇反驳道，“容易跌倒。”<br><br><br><br>“Bear but a touch of my hand there ,” said the Spirit, laying it upon his heart, “and you shall be upheld in more than this!”<br><br>“只轻轻摸一下我的手，”精灵说，把它放在他的心上，“你将得到比这更多的支持！”<br><br><br><br>As the words were spoken, they passed through the wall, and stood upon an open country road, with fields on either hand. The city had entirely vanished. Not a vestige of it was to be seen. The darkness and the mist had vanished with it, for it was a clear, cold, winter day, with snow upon the ground.<br><br>随着这些话的响起，它们穿过墙壁，站在一条开阔的乡村道路上，两边是田野。城市已经完全消失。看不到它的任何痕迹。黑暗和雾气也随之消失，因为那是一个晴朗、寒冷的冬日，地上覆盖着雪。<br><br><br><br>“Good Heaven!” said Scrooge, clasping his hands together, as he looked about him. “I was bred in this place. I was a boy here!”<br><br>“天哪！”斯克鲁奇一边说，一边双手合十，四处张望。“我就是在这个地方长大的。我是个男孩！”<br><br><br><br>The Spirit gazed upon him mildly. Its gentle touch, though it had been light and instantaneous, appeared still present to the old man’s sense of feeling. He was conscious of a thousand odours floating in the air, each one connected with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and cares long, long, forgotten!<br><br>精神温和地注视着他。它的温柔触摸，尽管轻柔而瞬间即逝，却仍然存在于老人的感觉中。他意识到空气中漂浮着成千上万的气味，每一个都与成千上万的思绪、希望、喜悦和久远的忧虑相连！<br><br><br><br>“Your lip is trembling,” said the Ghost. “And what is that upon your cheek?”<br><br><br><br>Scrooge muttered, with an unusual catching in his voice, that it was a pimple; and begged the Ghost to lead him where he would.<br><br>“你的嘴唇在颤抖，”幽灵说。“你脸颊上那是什么？” 斯克鲁奇声音中带着异样的颤抖，咕哝着说那是一个痘痘；并请求幽灵带他去他想去的地方。<br><br><br><br>“You recollect the way?” inquired the Spirit.<br><br>你记得那路吗？”精灵问道。<br><br><br><br>“Remember it!” cried Scrooge with fervour; “I could walk it blindfold.”<br><br>“记得！”斯克鲁奇激动地喊道；“我即使蒙上眼睛也能走这条路。”<br><br><br><br>“Strange to have forgotten it for so many years!” observed the Ghost. “Let us go on.”<br><br>“奇怪，竟然忘记了这么多年！”鬼魂评论道。“我们继续走吧。”<br><br><br><br>They walked along the road, Scrooge recognising every gate, and post, and tree; until a little market-town appeared in the distance, with its bridge, its church, and winding river. Some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them with boys upon their backs, who called to other boys in country gigs and carts, driven by farmers. All these boys were in great spirits, and shouted to each other, until the broad fields were so full of merry music, that the crisp air laughed to hear it!<br><br>他们沿着道路行走，斯克鲁奇认出了每一个大门、邮柱和树木；直到在远处出现了一个小市场镇，那里有桥梁、教堂和蜿蜒的河流。现在可以看到一些蓬乱的马匹驮着男孩们向他们跑来，男孩们对着乡村的马车和马车上的其他男孩呼喊，这些马车由农夫驾驶。所有这些男孩都兴高采烈，互相呼喊，直到宽阔的田野充满了欢乐的音乐，清新的空气听到这声音都笑了！<br><br><br><br>“These are but shadows of the things that have been,” said the Ghost. “They have no consciousness of us.”<br><br><br><br>The jocund travellers came on; and as they came, Scrooge knew and named them every one. Why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them! Why did his cold eye glisten, and his heart leap up as they went past! Why was he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other Merry Christmas, as they parted at cross-roads and bye-ways, for their several homes! What was merry Christmas to Scrooge? Out upon merry Christmas! What good had it ever done to him?<br><br>“这些只是过去事物的影子，”鬼魂说。“它们对我们没有意识。” 快乐的旅行者们继续前行；随着他们的到来，斯克鲁奇认出了他们每一个人。为什么他看到他们如此高兴！为什么他的冷漠的眼睛闪烁，他的心随着他们的经过而跳动！为什么他听到他们互相道别时，在交叉路口和旁道上为各自的家道别时，他感到如此快乐！对斯克鲁奇来说，快乐的圣诞节是什么？去他的快乐的圣诞节！它曾经对他有什么好处？<br><br><br><br>“The school is not quite deserted,” said the Ghost. “A solitary child, neglected by his friends, is left there still.”<br><br>学校并非完全荒废，”幽灵说。“还有一个孤独的孩子，被他的朋友们遗弃在那里。”<br><br><br><br>Scrooge said he knew it. And he sobbed.<br><br><br><br>They left the high-road, by a well-remembered lane, and soon approached a mansion of dull red brick, with a little weathercock-surmounted cupola, on the roof, and a bell hanging in it. It was a large house, but one of broken fortunes; for the spacious offices were little used, their walls were damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their gates decayed. Fowls clucked and strutted in the stables; and the coach-houses and sheds were over-run with grass. Nor was it more retentive of its ancient state, within; for entering the dreary hall, and glancing through the open doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished, cold, and vast. There was an earthy savour in the air, a chilly bareness in the place, which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by candle-light, and not too much to eat.<br><br>斯克鲁奇说他知道。然后他哭了。 他们离开了大路，沿着一条记忆中的小路，很快来到了一栋灰红色的砖房前，屋顶上有一个小风向标塔楼，里面挂着一个铃铛。这是一栋大房子，但财富已经破碎；宽敞的办公室很少使用，墙壁潮湿多苔，窗户破碎，大门腐朽。鸡在马厩里咕咕叫，走来走去；马车房和棚屋被草覆盖。内部也并没有保留其古老的状态；他们走进阴森的大厅，透过敞开的门瞥见许多房间，发现它们陈设简陋，寒冷而空旷。空气中有一股土腥味，地方冷清而裸露，似乎与过多使用蜡烛照明有关，而食物却不多。<br><br><br><br>They went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a door at the back of the house. It opened before them, and disclosed a long, bare, melancholy room, made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and desks. At one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire; and Scrooge sat down upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he used to be.<br><br>他们，幽灵和斯克鲁奇，穿过大厅，来到房子后面的一个门口。门在他们面前打开，露出一间又长又空旷、忧郁的房间，线条简洁的橡木桌椅和书桌使房间显得更加空旷。在这些桌子中的一张旁边，一个孤独的男孩在靠近微弱的火光阅读；斯克鲁奇坐在一张桌子上，看到他可怜的、被遗忘的过去自己，不禁泪流满面。<br><br><br><br>Not a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle from the mice behind the panelling, not a drip from the half-thawed water-spout in the dull yard behind, not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar, not the idle swinging of an empty store-house door, no, not a clicking in the fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with a softening influence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.<br><br>房子里没有一丝隐约的回声，没有从护墙板后面传来的老鼠的吱吱声和打闹声，没有从后面阴暗院子里半融化的水龙头滴下的水声，没有一棵绝望的柳树无叶枝头的叹息声，没有空荡荡的仓库门的闲荡摆动声，不，连火中的咔哒声都没有，但这一切都温柔地影响了斯克鲁奇的心，让他的泪水更加自由地流淌。<br><br><br><br>The Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his younger self, intent upon his reading. Suddenly a man, in foreign garments: wonderfully real and distinct to look at: stood outside the window, with an axe stuck in his belt, and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood.<br><br>精灵拍了拍他的手臂，指向他年轻时的自己，正专心致志地阅读。突然，一个穿着外国服装的人站在窗外，看起来非常真实和清晰：腰间插着斧头，牵着拴着木头的驴子。<br><br><br><br>“Why, it’s Ali Baba!” Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy. “It’s dear old honest Ali Baba! Yes, yes, I know! One Christmas time, when yonder solitary child was left here all alone, he did come, for the first time, just like that. Poor boy! And Valentine,” said Scrooge, “and his wild brother, Orson; there they go! And what’s his name, who was put down in his drawers, asleep, at the Gate of Damascus; don’t you see him! And the Sultan’s Groom turned upside down by the Genii; there he is upon his head! Serve him right. I’m glad of it. What business had he to be married to the Princess!”<br><br>“哎呀，原来是阿里巴巴！”斯克鲁奇欣喜若狂地喊道。“亲爱的、诚实的阿里巴巴！是的，是的，我知道！就在那个圣诞节，当那个孤独的孩子被留在这里的时候，他第一次就这样出现了。可怜的孩子！还有瓦伦丁，”斯克鲁奇说，“还有他那个野性的兄弟奥森；他们走了！那个被放在大马士革城门口抽屉里、睡着的男孩是谁，你没看见他吗！还有苏丹的仆人被妖怪翻了个底朝天；他就在头上！这是他应得的。我很高兴。他有什么资格娶公主！”<br><br><br><br>To hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such subjects, in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying; and to see his heightened and excited face; would have been a surprise to his business friends in the city, indeed.<br><br>听到斯克鲁奇如此真诚地用一种介于笑和哭之间的奇特声音谈论这些话题；看到他激动和兴奋的脸庞；确实会让他城里的商业朋友们感到惊讶。<br><br><br><br>“There’s the Parrot!” cried Scrooge. “Green body and yellow tail, with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head; there he is! Poor Robin Crusoe, he called him, when he came home again after sailing round the island. ‘Poor Robin Crusoe, where have you been, Robin Crusoe?’ The man thought he was dreaming, but he wasn’t. It was the Parrot, you know. There goes Friday, running for his life to the little creek! Halloa! Hoop! Halloo!”<br><br>“那是鹦鹉！”斯克鲁奇喊道。“绿色的身体，黄色的尾巴，头顶上长着一棵像生菜一样的东西；就在那里！可怜的罗宾逊·克鲁索，他回家后称它为罗宾逊·克鲁索。‘可怜的罗宾逊·克鲁索，罗宾逊·克鲁索，你去哪里了？’那个人以为他在做梦，但他不是。那是鹦鹉，你知道的。弗莱迪跑了，向小溪跑去，拼命逃跑！喂！呼！哈哈！”<br><br><br><br>Then, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character, he said, in pity for his former self, “Poor boy!” and cried again.<br><br>然后，他迅速地转换了语气，与他平时的性格截然不同，带着对过去的自己的同情，他说：“可怜的孩子！”然后又哭了起来。<br><br><br><br>“I wish,” Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his pocket, and looking about him, after drying his eyes with his cuff: “but it’s too late now.”<br><br>“我希望，”斯克鲁奇咕哝着，把手伸进口袋，擦了擦眼睛，环顾四周：“但现在太晚了。”<br><br><br><br>“What is the matter?” asked the Spirit.<br><br>“怎么了？”精灵问道。<br><br><br><br>“Nothing,” said Scrooge. “Nothing. There was a boy singing a Christmas Carol at my door last night. I should like to have given him something: that’s all.”<br><br>“没什么，”斯克鲁奇说。“没什么。昨晚有个男孩在我门口唱圣诞颂歌。我想给他点东西：就这些。”<br><br><br><br>The Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand: saying as it did so, “Let us see another Christmas!”<br><br>鬼魂若有所思地笑了笑，挥了挥手：一边做一边说，“让我们看看另一个圣诞节吧！”<br><br><br><br>Scrooge’s former self grew larger at the words, and the room became a little darker and more dirty. The panels shrunk, the windows cracked; fragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling, and the naked laths were shown instead; but how all this was brought about, Scrooge knew no more than you do. He only knew that it was quite correct; that everything had happened so; that there he was, alone again, when all the other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays.<br><br>斯克鲁奇过去的自己随着这些话变得更大，房间变得稍微暗一些，也更脏了。面板缩小了，窗户裂开了；天花板上的灰泥碎片掉落，裸露的椽子露了出来；但这一切是如何发生的，斯克鲁奇知道的并不比你多。他只知道这是完全正确的；一切都是这样发生的；当所有其他男孩都回家享受欢乐的假期时，他又独自一人站在那里。<br><br><br><br>He was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly. Scrooge looked at the Ghost, and with a mournful shaking of his head, glanced anxiously towards the door.<br><br>他现在没有在阅读，而是在绝望地走来走去。斯克鲁奇看着那个鬼魂，用悲伤的摇头，焦急地朝门口看去。<br><br><br><br>It opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy, came darting in, and putting her arms about his neck, and often kissing him, addressed him as her “Dear, dear brother.”<br><br>门开了；一个比那个男孩小得多的女孩冲了进来，抱着他的脖子，经常亲吻他，称他为她的“亲爱的，亲爱的哥哥。”<br><br><br><br>“I have come to bring you home, dear brother!” said the child, clapping her tiny hands, and bending down to laugh. “To bring you home, home, home!”<br><br>“我来带你回家，亲爱的哥哥！”孩子拍着手，弯下腰笑着说道。“带你回家，家，家！”<br><br><br><br>“Home, little Fan?” returned the boy.<br><br>“家，小帆？”男孩回答道。<br><br><br><br>“Yes!” said the child, brimful of glee. “Home, for good and all. Home, for ever and ever. Father is so much kinder than he used to be, that home’s like Heaven! He spoke so gently to me one dear night when I was going to bed, that I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come home; and he said Yes, you should; and sent me in a coach to bring you. And you’re to be a man!” said the child, opening her eyes, “and are never to come back here; but first, we’re to be together all the Christmas long, and have the merriest time in all the world.”<br><br>“是的！”孩子说，满脸喜悦。“永远的家。永远的家。父亲现在比以前好多了，家就像天堂！在我上床睡觉的那个可爱的夜晚，他对我说话那么温柔，我都不怕再问他一次你能不能回家；他说可以，你应该；然后派了一辆马车来接你。你将成为一个男人！”孩子睁开眼睛说，“永远不会再回来这里；但首先，我们要在圣诞节一起度过，享受世界上最快乐的时间。”<br><br><br><br>“You are quite a woman, little Fan!” exclaimed the boy.<br><br>“你真是个女人，小凡！”男孩惊呼。<br><br><br><br>She clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his head; but being too little, laughed again, and stood on tiptoe to embrace him. Then she began to drag him, in her childish eagerness, towards the door; and he, nothing loth to go, accompanied her.<br><br>她拍着手大笑，试图摸他的头；但太小了，又笑了，踮起脚尖去拥抱他。然后她开始拉着他，带着孩子般的热情，朝门口走去；而他，一点也不想离开，跟着她一起走。<br><br><br><br>A terrible voice in the hall cried, “Bring down Master Scrooge’s box, there!” and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself, who glared on Master Scrooge with a ferocious condescension, and threw him into a dreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him. He then conveyed him and his sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best-parlour that ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial and terrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold. Here he produced a decanter of curiously light wine, and a block of curiously heavy cake, and administered instalments of those dainties to the young people: at the same time, sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of “something” to the postboy, who answered that he thanked the gentleman, but if it was the same tap as he had tasted before, he had rather not. Master Scrooge’s trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the chaise, the children bade the schoolmaster good-bye right willingly; and getting into it, drove gaily down the garden-sweep: the quick wheels dashing the hoar-frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the evergreens like spray.<br><br>大厅里传来一声可怕的声音：“把斯克鲁奇先生的箱子拿下来，就在那里！”随后，校长本人出现在大厅里，他带着一种凶狠的傲慢目光盯着斯克鲁奇先生，与他握手时让他陷入了极度的恐慌。接着，他把他和他的妹妹带到了一个极其古老的客厅的井口，那里墙上挂着的地图，以及窗户里的天体和地球仪都因寒冷而变得蜡质。在这里，他拿出了一瓶奇轻的酒和一块奇重的蛋糕，给年轻人分发这些美食：同时，派出一个瘦弱的仆人去给邮差拿一杯“东西”，邮差回答说，他感谢这位绅士，但如果和之前喝的一样，他宁愿不喝。这时，斯克鲁奇先生的箱子已经被绑在马车顶上，孩子们很乐意地与校长告别；然后他们坐进马车，欢快地驶过花园小径：车轮快速地溅起常青树的暗叶上的霜雪，就像喷泉一样。<br><br><br><br>“Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have withered,” said the Ghost. “But she had a large heart!”<br><br>“一直是个娇弱的生命，稍有不慎就会枯萎，”幽灵说。“但她有一颗宽广的心！”<br><br><br><br>“So she had,” cried Scrooge. “You’re right. I will not gainsay it, Spirit. God forbid!”<br><br>“她确实有，”斯克鲁奇喊道。“你说得对。我不会反驳，幽灵。上帝保佑！”<br><br><br><br>“She died a woman,” said the Ghost, “and had, as I think, children.”<br><br>“她作为女人去世了，”幽灵说，“我想她还有孩子。”<br><br><br><br>“One child,” Scrooge returned.<br><br>“一个孩子，”斯克鲁奇回答道。<br><br><br><br>“True,” said the Ghost. “Your nephew!”<br><br>“没错，”幽灵说。“你的侄子！”<br><br><br><br>Scrooge seemed uneasy in his mind; and answered briefly, “Yes.”<br><br>斯克鲁奇似乎心中不安，简短地回答：“是的。”<br><br><br><br>Although they had but that moment left the school behind them, they were now in the busy thoroughfares of a city, where shadowy passengers passed and repassed; where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the way, and all the strife and tumult of a real city were. It was made plain enough, by the dressing of the shops, that here too it was Christmas time again; but it was evening, and the streets were lighted up.<br><br>尽管他们离开学校才那一会儿，现在却置身于城市的繁忙街道上，那里有模糊的乘客来来往往；有模糊的货车和马车争抢道路，整个城市的喧嚣和骚动都在这里。从商店的装饰来看，很明显这里又到了圣诞节；但已是傍晚，街道被灯光照亮。<br><br><br><br>The Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked Scrooge if he knew it.<br><br><br><br>“Know it!” said Scrooge. “Was I apprenticed here!”<br><br>鬼魂在一扇仓库门前停下，问斯克鲁奇是否认识这里。 “认识！”斯克鲁奇说，“我在这里当学徒吗！”<br><br><br><br>They went in. At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh wig, sitting behind such a high desk, that if he had been two inches taller he must have knocked his head against the ceiling, Scrooge cried in great excitement:<br><br>他们进去了。一看到一位戴着威尔士假发的老先生坐在高高的办公桌后面，如果他再高两英寸，他的头肯定会撞到天花板，斯克鲁奇兴奋地大喊：<br><br><br><br>“Why, it’s old Fezziwig! Bless his heart; it’s Fezziwig alive again!”<br><br><br><br>Old Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the clock, which pointed to the hour of seven. He rubbed his hands; adjusted his capacious waistcoat; laughed all over himself, from his shoes to his organ of benevolence; and called out in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat, jovial voice:<br><br>“哎呀，那是老菲兹齐格！愿他的心得到祝福；菲兹齐格又活回来了！” 老菲兹齐格放下他的笔，抬头看钟，指针指向七点。他搓了搓手；调整了他宽敞的背心；从头到他的仁慈之心，他笑得全身发抖；用舒适、油腻、丰富、丰满、愉快的嗓音喊道：<br><br><br><br>“Yo ho, there! Ebenezer! Dick!”<br><br>“哟吼，嘿！伊本尼泽！迪克！”<br><br><br><br>Scrooge’s former self, now grown a young man, came briskly in, accompanied by his fellow-’prentice.<br><br>斯克鲁奇的前身，如今已长大成人，急匆匆地走了进来，身边跟着他的同伴学徒。<br><br><br><br>“Dick Wilkins, to be sure!” said Scrooge to the Ghost. “Bless me, yes. There he is. He was very much attached to me, was Dick. Poor Dick! Dear, dear!”<br><br><br><br>“Yo ho, my boys!” said Fezziwig. “No more work to-night. Christmas Eve, Dick. Christmas, Ebenezer! Let’s have the shutters up,” cried old Fezziwig, with a sharp clap of his hands, “before a man can say Jack Robinson!”<br><br>“当然是大卫·威尔金斯！”斯克鲁奇对鬼魂说。“哎呀，没错。就是他。他非常依恋我，大卫。可怜的大卫！亲爱的，亲爱的！” “嘿咻，我的小伙子们！”费兹维格说。“今晚不用再工作了。大卫，圣诞夜。圣诞，伊布内泽！让我们把百叶窗拉上，”老费兹维格一边说着，一边猛地一拍手，“在人说‘杰克·罗宾逊’之前！”<br><br><br><br>You wouldn’t believe how those two fellows went at it! They charged into the street with the shutters—one, two, three—had ’em up in their places—four, five, six—barred ’em and pinned ’em—seven, eight, nine—and came back before you could have got to twelve, panting like race-horses.<br><br>你不会相信那两个家伙是怎么打起来的！他们带着百叶窗冲进街道——一、二、三——把百叶窗都放到位——四、五、六——关上并固定——七、八、九——在你数到十二之前就回来了，喘得像赛马一样。<br><br><br><br>“Hilli-ho!” cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the high desk, with wonderful agility. “Clear away, my lads, and let’s have lots of room here! Hilli-ho, Dick! Chirrup, Ebenezer!”<br><br>“嗨嚯！”老菲齐威格叫道，从高桌子上跳下来，动作敏捷得惊人。“清理一下，我的小伙子们，让我们这里多留点空间！嗨嚯，迪克！吱吱，伊布尼泽！”<br><br><br><br>Clear away! There was nothing they wouldn’t have cleared away, or couldn’t have cleared away, with old Fezziwig looking on. It was done in a minute. Every movable was packed off, as if it were dismissed from public life for evermore; the floor was swept and watered, the lamps were trimmed, fuel was heaped upon the fire; and the warehouse was as snug, and warm, and dry, and bright a ball-room, as you would desire to see upon a winter’s night.<br><br>清理！在老菲齐威格的注视下，他们什么都能清理，什么都能清理干净。一分钟内就完成了。所有可移动的物品都被打包带走，好像永远从公众生活中消失了一样；地板被扫过并洒了水，灯被修剪过，燃料堆在火上；仓库就像一个舒适的、温暖的、干燥的、明亮的舞厅，就像你在冬夜想要看到的舞厅一样。<br><br><br><br>In came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the lofty desk, and made an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty stomach-aches. In came Mrs. Fezziwig, one vast substantial smile. In came the three Miss Fezziwigs, beaming and lovable. In came the six young followers whose hearts they broke. In came all the young men and women employed in the business. In came the housemaid, with her cousin, the baker. In came the cook, with her brother’s particular friend, the milkman. In came the boy from over the way, who was suspected of not having board enough from his master; trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one, who was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress. In they all came, one after another; some shyly, some boldly, some gracefully, some awkwardly, some pushing, some pulling; in they all came, anyhow and everyhow. Away they all went, twenty couple at once; hands half round and back again the other way; down the middle and up again; round and round in various stages of affectionate grouping; old top couple always turning up in the wrong place; new top couple starting off again, as soon as they got there; all top couples at last, and not a bottom one to help them! When this result was brought about, old Fezziwig, clapping his hands to stop the dance, cried out, “Well done!” and the fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter, especially provided for that purpose. But scorning rest, upon his reappearance, he instantly began again, though there were no dancers yet, as if the other fiddler had been carried home, exhausted, on a shutter, and he were a bran-new man resolved to beat him out of sight, or perish.<br><br>一位小提琴手带着乐谱走了进来，走到高高的桌子旁，把它变成了一支乐队，调试得像五十个胃痛一样。菲齐维格夫人走了进来，带着一个巨大的、真诚的微笑。三位菲齐维格小姐走了进来，容光焕发，可爱动人。六位年轻的追随者走了进来，他们的心被她们打动了。所有在业务中工作的年轻男女都走了进来。女仆带着她的表兄，面包师傅走了进来。厨师带着她哥哥的特别朋友，牛奶夫走了进来。从对面走来一个男孩，有人怀疑他主人给他的食物不够；他试图躲在隔壁第二家的女孩身后，据证明她的耳朵是被她的女主人拉扯的。他们一个接一个地走了进来；有的害羞，有的大胆，有的优雅，有的笨拙，有的推，有的拉；无论如何，他们都走了进来。 他们都走了，二十对一起；手半圈又转回来；穿过中间又上去；绕来绕去，各种亲昵的分组；老顶对总是出现在错误的地方；新顶对一到那里就又开始；最后都是顶对，没有一个底对来帮忙！当这个结果出现时，老菲齐维格拍着手停止了舞蹈，大声喊道：“干得好！”小提琴手把热脸埋进特意准备的波特酒壶里。但他在再次出现时，不屑休息，立刻又开始演奏，尽管还没有舞者，就像另一个小提琴手被累得抬回家，躺在百叶窗上，而他像是一个全新的男人，决心把他比下去，或者死去。<br><br><br><br>There were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more dances, and there was cake, and there was negus, and there was a great piece of Cold Roast, and there was a great piece of Cold Boiled, and there were mince-pies, and plenty of beer. But the great effect of the evening came after the Roast and Boiled, when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind! The sort of man who knew his business better than you or I could have told it him!) struck up “Sir Roger de Coverley.” Then old Fezziwig stood out to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig. Top couple, too; with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them; three or four and twenty pair of partners; people who were not to be trifled with; people who would dance, and had no notion of walking.<br><br>那里有更多的舞蹈，还有惩罚，更多的舞蹈，还有蛋糕，还有 negus，还有一大块冷烤肉，还有一大块冷煮肉，还有肉馅饼，还有足够的啤酒。但晚上的最大效果是在烤肉和煮肉之后，当小提琴手（注意，是一只狡猾的狗！那种比你我更了解自己业务的人！）开始演奏“罗杰·德·科弗利爵士”。然后老菲齐威格站出来和菲齐威格夫人跳舞。也是一对顶尖的舞伴；他们有一项艰巨的任务；三二十对舞伴；这些人不容小觑；这些人会跳舞，不会走路。<br><br><br><br>Mr. Fezziwig’s Ball But if they had been twice as many—ah, four times—old Fezziwig would have been a match for them, and so would Mrs. Fezziwig. As to her , she was worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term. If that’s not high praise, tell me higher, and I’ll use it. A positive light appeared to issue from Fezziwig’s calves. They shone in every part of the dance like moons. You couldn’t have predicted, at any given time, what would have become of them next. And when old Fezziwig and Mrs. Fezziwig had gone all through the dance; advance and retire, both hands to your partner, bow and curtsey, corkscrew, thread-the-needle, and back again to your place; Fezziwig “cut”—cut so deftly, that he appeared to wink with his legs, and came upon his feet again without a stagger.<br><br>费兹齐格先生的舞会，但如果人数是现在的两倍——啊，四倍——老费兹齐格就能与他们匹敌，费兹齐格太太也能。至于她，她方方面面都配得上成为他的伴侣。如果这不是极高的赞誉，请告诉我更高的，我会使用的。一股光芒似乎从费兹齐格的小腿散发出来。在舞会的每个角落，它们都像月亮一样闪耀。在任何时候，你都无法预测他们接下来会变成什么样。当老费兹齐格和费兹齐格太太跳完整个舞；前进和后退，双手与舞伴相握，鞠躬和屈膝，螺旋形旋转，穿针引线，然后回到自己的位置；费兹齐格“切”——切得如此熟练，以至于他似乎用腿眨眼，而且没有踉跄地重新站稳。<br><br><br><br>When the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up. Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig took their stations, one on either side of the door, and shaking hands with every person individually as he or she went out, wished him or her a Merry Christmas. When everybody had retired but the two ’prentices, they did the same to them; and thus the cheerful voices died away, and the lads were left to their beds; which were under a counter in the back-shop.<br><br>当钟敲响十一点时，这场家庭舞会结束了。费兹吉维先生和夫人站在门口两侧，每个人出来时都和他们一一握手，祝愿他们圣诞快乐。当所有人都离开，只剩下两个学徒时，他们也向他们致意；于是欢快的笑声渐渐消失，孩子们回到了床上；这些床位于后店里的柜台下面。<br><br><br><br>During the whole of this time, Scrooge had acted like a man out of his wits. His heart and soul were in the scene, and with his former self. He corroborated everything, remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and underwent the strangest agitation. It was not until now, when the bright faces of his former self and Dick were turned from them, that he remembered the Ghost, and became conscious that it was looking full upon him, while the light upon its head burnt very clear.<br><br><br><br>“A small matter,” said the Ghost, “to make these silly folks so full of gratitude.”<br><br>在整个这段时间里，斯克鲁奇表现得像个疯子。他的心和灵魂都沉浸在这场场景中，与过去的自己融为一体。他证实了一切，记得一切，享受一切，经历了最奇怪的激动。直到现在，当过去的自己和狄克的明亮面孔从他们面前转开时，他才想起了鬼魂，并意识到它正全神贯注地看着他，而它头上的灯光非常明亮。 “小事一桩，”鬼魂说，“让这些愚蠢的人如此充满感激。”<br><br><br><br>“Small!” echoed Scrooge. “小！”斯克鲁奇回应道。<br><br><br><br>The Spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices, who were pouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig: and when he had done so, said,<br><br>精灵示意他倾听两个学徒的赞美，他们正在倾吐对费兹维格的敬意：听完之后，精灵说，<br><br><br><br>“Why! Is it not? He has spent but a few pounds of your mortal money: three or four perhaps. Is that so much that he deserves this praise?”<br><br>“哎呀！难道不是吗？他不过花了几英镑你的凡人之钱：三四个英镑或许。这难道不值得这样的赞美吗？”<br><br><br><br>“It isn’t that,” said Scrooge, heated by the remark, and speaking unconsciously like his former, not his latter, self. “It isn’t that, Spirit. He has the power to render us happy or unhappy; to make our service light or burdensome; a pleasure or a toil. Say that his power lies in words and looks; in things so slight and insignificant that it is impossible to add and count ’em up: what then? The happiness he gives, is quite as great as if it cost a fortune.”<br><br>“不是那样，”斯克鲁奇激动地说，不知不觉地像他以前的样子，而不是后来的样子。“不是那样，精灵。他有能力让我们快乐或不快乐；让我们的服务轻松或沉重；是乐趣还是劳苦。说他的力量在于言语和表情；在于如此微小而微不足道的事物，以至于无法一一列举：那又如何？他给予的幸福，和花费一大笔钱一样大。”<br><br><br><br>He felt the Spirit’s glance, and stopped.<br><br><br><br>“What is the matter?” asked the Ghost.<br><br>“怎么了？”幽灵问道。<br><br><br><br>“Nothing particular,” said Scrooge.<br><br>他感觉到精灵的目光，然后停了下来。 “没什么特别的，”斯克鲁奇说。<br><br><br><br>“Something, I think?” the Ghost insisted.<br><br>“这，我想？”幽灵坚持道。<br><br><br><br>“No,” said Scrooge, “No. I should like to be able to say a word or two to my clerk just now. That’s all.”<br><br>“不，”斯克鲁奇说，“不。我现在很想对我的职员说几句话。就这些。”<br><br><br><br>His former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance to the wish; and Scrooge and the Ghost again stood side by side in the open air.<br><br>他曾经的自己熄灭了灯，说出了这个愿望；斯克鲁奇和鬼魂再次并排站在户外。<br><br><br><br>“My time grows short,” observed the Spirit. “Quick!”<br><br>“我的时间不多了，”精灵观察道。“快！”<br><br><br><br>This was not addressed to Scrooge, or to any one whom he could see, but it produced an immediate effect. For again Scrooge saw himself. He was older now; a man in the prime of life. His face had not the harsh and rigid lines of later years; but it had begun to wear the signs of care and avarice. There was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye, which showed the passion that had taken root, and where the shadow of the growing tree would fall.<br><br>这封信并非写给斯克鲁奇的，也不是写给任何他能看见的人，但它立刻产生了效果。因为斯克鲁奇又看到了自己。他现在更老了；一个处于人生巅峰的男人。他的脸上没有后来岁月那般严厉和僵硬的线条；但已经开始显露出忧虑和贪婪的痕迹。眼中有一种渴望、贪婪、不安的动作，显示出那已经扎根的热情，以及那不断生长的树影将落在哪里。<br><br><br><br>He was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young girl in a mourning-dress: in whose eyes there were tears, which sparkled in the light that shone out of the Ghost of Christmas Past.<br><br><br><br>“It matters little,” she said, softly. “To you, very little. Another idol has displaced me; and if it can cheer and comfort you in time to come, as I would have tried to do, I have no just cause to grieve.”<br><br>他并不孤单，而是坐在一位穿着丧服的美丽年轻女孩旁边：她的眼中含着泪水，在圣诞过去之灵的光芒中闪烁。 “这没什么关系，”她轻声说。“对你来说，非常不重要。另一个偶像取代了我；如果它能在将来给你带来安慰和快乐，就像我会尝试去做的那样，我没有理由感到悲伤。”<br><br><br><br>“What Idol has displaced you?” he rejoined.<br><br>“哪个偶像取代了你？”他接着问。<br><br><br><br>“A golden one.” “一个金色的。”<br><br><br><br>“This is the even-handed dealing of the world!” he said. “There is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty; and there is nothing it professes to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of wealth!”<br><br>“这就是世界的公平交易！”他说，“没有什么比贫穷更难对付；也没有什么它像追求财富那样严厉谴责！”<br><br><br><br>“You fear the world too much,” she answered, gently. “All your other hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its sordid reproach. I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until the master-passion, Gain, engrosses you. Have I not?”<br><br>“你太害怕这个世界了，”她温柔地回答，“你所有的其他希望都融入了对超越其污秽指责机会的希望。我看到你更高尚的抱负一个个落空，直到贪婪的激情占据了你。难道我没有吗？”<br><br><br><br>“What then?” he retorted. “Even if I have grown so much wiser, what then? I am not changed towards you.”<br><br><br><br>She shook her head. “那又怎样？”他反驳道，“即使我变得如此聪明，那又怎样？我对你的态度并没有改变。” 她摇了摇头。<br><br><br><br>“Am I?” “我是吗？”<br><br><br><br>“Our contract is an old one. It was made when we were both poor and content to be so, until, in good season, we could improve our worldly fortune by our patient industry. You are changed. When it was made, you were another man.”<br><br>我们的合同是一份旧合同。当时我们都很贫穷，却满足于这种生活，直到在适当的时机，我们能通过耐心勤劳改善我们的物质财富。你已经变了。签订合同时，你是一个不同的人。<br><br><br><br>“I was a boy,” he said impatiently.<br><br>“我是一个男孩，”他不耐烦地说。<br><br><br><br>“Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you are,” she returned. “I am. That which promised happiness when we were one in heart, is fraught with misery now that we are two. How often and how keenly I have thought of this, I will not say. It is enough that I have thought of it, and can release you.”<br><br>“你自己的感觉告诉你，你不是你现在这个样子，”她回答道。“我是。那在我们心灵相通时承诺带来幸福的东西，现在我们分开后却充满了痛苦。我有多么频繁和多么深刻地想过这一点，我不会说出来。只要我想过这一点，并且能够让你解脱。”<br><br><br><br>“Have I ever sought release?”<br><br>“我是否曾寻求解脱？”<br><br><br><br>“In words. No. Never.” “在言语上。不，从未。”<br><br><br><br>“In what, then?” “那么，在什么？”<br><br><br><br>“In a changed nature; in an altered spirit; in another atmosphere of life; another Hope as its great end. In everything that made my love of any worth or value in your sight. If this had never been between us,” said the girl, looking mildly, but with steadiness, upon him; “tell me, would you seek me out and try to win me now? Ah, no!”<br><br>“在改变的自然；在改变的精神；在另一种生活氛围；以另一种希望作为其伟大的目标。在我所做的一切，使你在我的眼中对爱情有任何价值或价值的东西。如果这从未在我们之间发生过，”女孩温和地看着他，但眼神坚定；“告诉我，你现在会寻找我并试图赢得我吗？啊，不！”<br><br><br><br>He seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition, in spite of himself. But he said with a struggle, “You think not.”<br><br>他似乎无法抗拒这个假设的公正，尽管他内心并不愿意。但他挣扎着说：“你不这么认为。”<br><br><br><br>“I would gladly think otherwise if I could,” she answered, “Heaven knows! When I have learned a Truth like this, I know how strong and irresistible it must be. But if you were free to-day, to-morrow, yesterday, can even I believe that you would choose a dowerless girl—you who, in your very confidence with her, weigh everything by Gain: or, choosing her, if for a moment you were false enough to your one guiding principle to do so, do I not know that your repentance and regret would surely follow? I do; and I release you. With a full heart, for the love of him you once were.”<br><br>“如果我能，我愿意有不同的想法，”她回答道，“天知道！当我学到这样的真理时，我知道它必须有多么强大和不可抗拒。但如果今天、明天、昨天你都是自由的，我甚至相信你会选择一个无嫁妆的女孩——你，在你对她无比信任的时候，衡量一切的标准都是利益：或者，如果你为了那一刻对你唯一指导原则的背叛而选择她，难道我不知道你的悔恨和遗憾一定会随之而来吗？我知道；我让你解脱。出于对你曾经是的那个人深深的爱。”<br><br><br><br>He was about to speak; but with her head turned from him, she resumed.<br><br>“如果我能的话，我愿意有不同的想法，”她回答，“天知道！当我学到这样一个真理时，我知道它必须有多么强大和不可抗拒。但如果今天、明天、昨天你都可以自由选择，我甚至能相信你会选择一个无嫁妆的女孩——你，在你与她无比信任的时候，总是以利益来衡量一切：或者，如果你一时之间背叛了你唯一的原则，选择了她，难道我不知道你的悔恨和遗憾一定会随之而来？我知道；我释放了你。出于对你曾经爱过的他的爱，我满怀诚意。” 他正要说话；但她把头转向了他，然后继续说。<br><br><br><br>“You may—the memory of what is past half makes me hope you will—have pain in this. A very, very brief time, and you will dismiss the recollection of it, gladly, as an unprofitable dream, from which it happened well that you awoke. May you be happy in the life you have chosen!”<br><br>“你可能——对过去的记忆有一半让我希望你会——在这件事上感到痛苦。但这是一段非常、非常短暂的时间，你将愉快地把它当作一个无益的梦忘记，幸运的是你醒了过来。愿你在选择的生活中幸福！”<br><br><br><br>She left him, and they parted.<br><br>她离开了他，他们分开了。<br><br><br><br>“Spirit!” said Scrooge, “show me no more! Conduct me home. Why do you delight to torture me?”<br><br>“精灵！”斯克鲁奇说，“别再让我受折磨了！带我去家。你为什么喜欢折磨我？”<br><br><br><br>“One shadow more!” exclaimed the Ghost.<br><br>“再多一个影子！”鬼魂惊呼道。<br><br><br><br>“No more!” cried Scrooge. “No more. I don’t wish to see it. Show me no more!”<br><br>“没有了！”斯克鲁奇喊道。“没有了。我不想再看到它了。别再让我看了！”<br><br><br><br>But the relentless Ghost pinioned him in both his arms, and forced him to observe what happened next.<br><br>但那个不屈不挠的鬼魂用双臂将他紧紧抱住，强迫他观察接下来发生的事情。<br><br><br><br>They were in another scene and place; a room, not very large or handsome, but full of comfort. Near to the winter fire sat a beautiful young girl, so like that last that Scrooge believed it was the same, until he saw her , now a comely matron, sitting opposite her daughter. The noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more children there, than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count; and, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were not forty children conducting themselves like one, but every child was conducting itself like forty. The consequences were uproarious beyond belief; but no one seemed to care; on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed heartily, and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to mingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands most ruthlessly. What would I not have given to be one of them! Though I never could have been so rude, no, no! I wouldn’t for the wealth of all the world have crushed that braided hair, and torn it down; and for the precious little shoe, I wouldn’t have plucked it off, God bless my soul! to save my life. As to measuring her waist in sport, as they did, bold young brood, I couldn’t have done it; I should have expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment, and never come straight again. And yet I should have dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips; to have questioned her, that she might have opened them; to have looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes, and never raised a blush; to have let loose waves of hair, an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price: in short, I should have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest licence of a child, and yet to have been man enough to know its value.<br><br>他们身处另一个场景和地方；一个不大也不算漂亮的房间，但充满了舒适。靠近冬天的壁炉坐着一位美丽的年轻女孩，她与上一个如此相似，以至于斯克鲁奇相信她们是同一个人，直到他看到她现在是一位端庄的少妇，坐在她女儿对面。这个房间的噪音完全混乱，因为那里的孩子比斯克鲁奇在他激动的心情下能数得过来的还要多；而且，与诗中著名的群童不同，他们不是四十个孩子表现得像一个整体，而是每个孩子都像四十个孩子一样行事。后果是喧嚣得难以置信；但似乎没有人介意；相反，母亲和女儿开心地大笑，玩得很开心；而且后者很快就加入到了游戏中，被年轻的海盗们最残忍地掠夺。我愿意付出任何代价成为他们中的一员！尽管我永远也不可能这么粗鲁，不，不！即使拥有全世界所有的财富，我也不愿意压碎那束辫子，把它扯下来；至于那双珍贵的小鞋，我绝不会为了救我的命而把它摘下来，愿上帝保佑我的灵魂！ 至于像他们那样大胆地量她的腰围，我做不到；我本以为我的手臂会因此变得粗壮，再也无法伸直。然而，我必须承认，我非常想亲吻她的嘴唇；想问她，让她张开嘴；想看着她垂下的眼帘，而不会引起一丝红晕；想让她松开波浪般的长发，其中一寸就能成为无价之宝：简而言之，我必须承认，我希望能拥有孩子般最轻微的自由，同时又有足够的男子气概去理解它的价值。<br><br><br><br>But now a knocking at the door was heard, and such a rush immediately ensued that she with laughing face and plundered dress was borne towards it the centre of a flushed and boisterous group, just in time to greet the father, who came home attended by a man laden with Christmas toys and presents. Then the shouting and the struggling, and the onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter! The scaling him with chairs for ladders to dive into his pockets, despoil him of brown-paper parcels, hold on tight by his cravat, hug him round his neck, pommel his back, and kick his legs in irrepressible affection! The shouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package was received! The terrible announcement that the baby had been taken in the act of putting a doll’s frying-pan into his mouth, and was more than suspected of having swallowed a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden platter! The immense relief of finding this a false alarm! The joy, and gratitude, and ecstasy! They are all indescribable alike. It is enough that by degrees the children and their emotions got out of the parlour, and by one stair at a time, up to the top of the house; where they went to bed, and so subsided.<br><br>但是，现在门被敲响了，紧接着发生了一场如此迅猛的冲撞，她带着笑意和破烂的衣衫，被一群红光满面、喧闹的人群簇拥着冲向门口，正好及时迎接回家的父亲，他身边跟着一个满载着圣诞玩具和礼物的人。然后是喧哗和挣扎，以及向那无助的门卫发起的攻击！用椅子当作梯子爬上去，掏他的口袋，夺走他的棕色纸包裹，紧紧抓住他的领带，搂住他的脖子，拍打他的背部，用无法抑制的喜爱踢他的腿！每个包裹被打开时发出的惊叫和喜悦！那个可怕的宣布说，婴儿在把玩具煎锅放进嘴里的时候被发现了，而且他吞下了一只粘在木盘上的虚构的火鸡，这超出了人们的怀疑！发现这只是一个虚惊一场时的极大宽慰！喜悦、感激和狂喜！它们都是无法形容的。 足够了，孩子们和他们的情绪逐渐离开了客厅，一级楼梯一级楼梯地，直到房子的顶层；他们在那里上床睡觉，于是平静下来。<br><br><br><br>And now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever, when the master of the house, having his daughter leaning fondly on him, sat down with her and her mother at his own fireside; and when he thought that such another creature, quite as graceful and as full of promise, might have called him father, and been a spring-time in the haggard winter of his life, his sight grew very dim indeed.<br><br>现在，斯克鲁奇比以往任何时候都更加专注地看着，当房子的主人，女儿依偎在他怀里，和他妻子还有她一起坐在自己的壁炉旁；当他想到这样的另一个生物，同样优雅，同样充满希望，本可以成为他的父亲，成为他生活中那个憔悴冬天的春天，他的视线确实变得非常模糊。<br><br><br><br>“Belle,” said the husband, turning to his wife with a smile, “I saw an old friend of yours this afternoon.”<br><br>“贝儿，”丈夫微笑着转向妻子说，“我今天下午看到了你的一位老朋友。”<br><br><br><br>“Who was it?” “是谁？”<br><br><br><br>“Guess!” “猜猜看！”<br><br><br><br>“How can I? Tut, don’t I know?” she added in the same breath, laughing as he laughed. “Mr. Scrooge.”<br><br>“我怎么可能不知道？”她一边说，一边笑着，和他一起笑。“斯克鲁奇先生。”<br><br><br><br>“Mr. Scrooge it was. I passed his office window; and as it was not shut up, and he had a candle inside, I could scarcely help seeing him. His partner lies upon the point of death, I hear; and there he sat alone. Quite alone in the world, I do believe.”<br><br>斯克鲁奇先生，正是。我路过他的办公室窗户；由于窗户没有关上，而且里面点着蜡烛，我几乎忍不住要看他。我听说他的合伙人快要死了；而他独自一人坐在那里。我相信，他是这个世界上唯一一个孤独的人。”<br><br><br><br>“Spirit!” said Scrooge in a broken voice, “remove me from this place.”<br><br><br><br>“I told you these were shadows of the things that have been,” said the Ghost. “That they are what they are, do not blame me!”<br><br>“精灵！”斯克鲁奇用颤抖的声音说，“把我从这个地方带走。” “我告诉你这些是过去的阴影，”幽灵说。“它们就是它们的样子，不要责怪我！”<br><br><br><br>“Remove me!” Scrooge exclaimed, “I cannot bear it!”<br><br>“把我赶走！”斯克鲁奇大声喊道，“我无法忍受了！”<br><br><br><br>He turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a face, in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces it had shown him, wrestled with it.<br><br>他转向那个鬼魂，看到它用一张脸看着他，那张脸上以一种奇怪的方式包含了它曾向他展示过的所有面孔的碎片，于是与他搏斗起来。<br><br><br><br>“Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!”<br><br>“离开我！把我带回去。别再纠缠我了！”<br><br><br><br>In the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost with no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort of its adversary, Scrooge observed that its light was burning high and bright; and dimly connecting that with its influence over him, he seized the extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its head.<br><br>在斗争中，如果这可以被称为斗争的话，鬼魂在其自身没有任何可见的抵抗下，没有被任何敌人的努力所打扰，斯克鲁奇观察到它的灯光燃烧得又高又亮；并且模糊地将其与其对他产生的影响联系起来，他抓起灭火器盖，突然按下它，压在它的头上。<br><br><br><br>The Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its whole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he could not hide the light: which streamed from under it, in an unbroken flood upon the ground.<br><br>鬼魂跌落在下面，灭火器覆盖了它的整个身体；但尽管斯克鲁奇用尽全力按下它，他无法隐藏灯光：它从下面流出来，形成一股不间断的洪水洒在地上。<br><br><br><br>He was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible drowsiness; and, further, of being in his own bedroom. He gave the cap a parting squeeze, in which his hand relaxed; and had barely time to reel to bed, before he sank into a heavy sleep.<br><br>他意识到自己筋疲力尽，被一种不可抗拒的困倦所压倒；而且，他还意识到自己在自己的卧室里。他在离开时捏了一下帽子，手放松了；他几乎没有时间摇晃着上床，就陷入了沉睡。<br><br><br><br>Scrooge Extinguishes the First of the Three Spirits<br><br>Scrooge 熄灭了三灵中的第一个<br><br><br><br>STAVE THREE. THE SECOND OF THE THREE SPIRITS. Awaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and sitting up in bed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had no occasion to be told that the bell was again upon the stroke of One. He felt that he was restored to consciousness in the right nick of time, for the especial purpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to him through Jacob Marley’s intervention. But finding that he turned uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this new spectre would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own hands; and lying down again, established a sharp look-out all round the bed. For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its appearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise, and made nervous.<br><br>第三幕。三个灵魂中的第二个。Scrooge 在一场震耳欲聋的鼾声中醒来，坐起身来整理思绪，他无需被告知钟声再次敲响一点。他感觉自己在恰到好处的时刻恢复了意识，专门为了与通过雅各布·马雷的干预派来的第二个使者进行会议。但当他开始怀疑这个新的幽灵会拉起哪一扇窗帘时，他感到很不舒服，于是亲自把所有的窗帘都拉开；然后再次躺下，在床周围保持高度警惕。因为他希望一看到幽灵就挑战它，不想被突然袭击，感到紧张。<br><br><br><br>Gentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being acquainted with a move or two, and being usually equal to the time-of-day, express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by observing that they are good for anything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter; between which opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide and comprehensive range of subjects. Without venturing for Scrooge quite as hardily as this, I don’t mind calling on you to believe that he was ready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing between a baby and rhinoceros would have astonished him very much.<br><br>绅士们，这类人随性自在，自诩懂得一些小伎俩，通常能应对各种场合，他们通过声称自己能从投掷游戏到谋杀等各种事情都能应对，来展示他们广泛的冒险能力；无疑，在这两个极端之间，存在着相当广泛和全面的主题范围。我不敢像这样大胆地挑战斯克鲁奇，但我并不介意请你相信，他准备好面对一个广阔的奇异景象领域，而且从婴儿到犀牛之间任何事物都不会让他感到惊讶。<br><br><br><br>Now, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means prepared for nothing; and, consequently, when the Bell struck One, and no shape appeared, he was taken with a violent fit of trembling. Five minutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour went by, yet nothing came. All this time, he lay upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze of ruddy light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the hour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than a dozen ghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant, or would be at; and was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an interesting case of spontaneous combustion, without having the consolation of knowing it. At last, however, he began to think—as you or I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not in the predicament who knows what ought to have been done in it, and would unquestionably have done it too—at last, I say, he began to think that the source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining room, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea taking full possession of his mind, he got up softly and shuffled in his slippers to the door.<br><br>现在，他几乎为任何事情都做好了准备，但无论如何也不是为“无”做好准备；因此，当钟声敲响一点，却什么形状都没有出现时，他突然感到一阵剧烈的颤抖。五分钟，十分钟，一刻钟过去了，什么都没有发生。在这段时间里，他躺在床上，正是那束红光的核心和中心，当钟声宣布时间时，这束光照射在他身上；由于只是光，它比一打鬼魂还要令人惊恐，因为他无法弄清楚这究竟意味着什么，或者会变成什么；有时他担心自己可能在这一刻正是一个有趣的自燃案例，却连知道这一点的心安理得都没有。然而，最后，他开始思考——就像你或我最初会想的那样；因为总是不在困境中的人知道在这种情况下应该做什么，毫无疑问也会这么做——最后，我说，他开始认为这鬼火的光源和秘密可能就在相邻的房间里，因为从那里，进一步追踪它，它似乎在发光。 这个想法完全占据了他的思想，他轻轻地站起来，穿着拖鞋走向门口。<br><br><br><br>The moment Scrooge’s hand was on the lock, a strange voice called him by his name, and bade him enter. He obeyed.<br><br>就在斯克鲁奇的手放在锁上时，一个奇怪的声音叫着他的名字，让他进去。他服从了。<br><br><br><br>It was his own room. There was no doubt about that. But it had undergone a surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling were so hung with living green, that it looked a perfect grove; from every part of which, bright gleaming berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe, and ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had been scattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney, as that dull petrification of a hearth had never known in Scrooge’s time, or Marley’s, or for many and many a winter season gone. Heaped up on the floor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages, mince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts, cherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense twelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that made the chamber dim with their delicious steam. In easy state upon this couch, there sat a jolly Giant, glorious to see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not unlike Plenty’s horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on Scrooge, as he came peeping round the door.<br><br>这是他自己的房间。这一点毫无疑问。但房间经历了惊人的变化。墙壁和天花板挂满了生机勃勃的绿色，看起来就像一个完美的树林；从每个角落，明亮的闪亮的浆果都在闪烁。冬青、寄生和常春藤的清新叶子反射着光线，就像那里散落了许多小镜子；而且从烟囱里升起的熊熊火焰，是斯克鲁奇时代、马雷时代，或者过去许多个冬天，那个阴暗的炉火从未有过的。地板上堆满了火鸡、鹅、猎物、家禽、腌肉、大块肉、小猪、长长的香肠卷、肉馅饼、李子布丁、牡蛎桶、滚烫的栗子、红脸苹果、多汁的橙子、美味的梨、巨大的十二蛋糕，以及沸腾的鸡尾酒碗，它们那美味的蒸汽使房间变得昏暗。在这张沙发上，坐着一个快乐的巨人，看起来非常壮观；他手持一盏发光的火炬，形状与丰收之角不相上下，高举着，为斯克鲁奇照亮，当他偷偷地从门口窥视时。<br><br><br><br>“Come in!” exclaimed the Ghost. “Come in! and know me better, man!”<br><br>“进来！”鬼魂大声说道，“进来！让我更了解你，人啊！”<br><br><br><br>Scrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this Spirit. He was not the dogged Scrooge he had been; and though the Spirit’s eyes were clear and kind, he did not like to meet them.<br><br>斯克鲁奇胆怯地走了进来，低垂着头站在这个精灵面前。他不再是那个固执的斯克鲁奇；尽管精灵的眼睛清澈而慈祥，他也不愿与它们对视。<br><br><br><br>“I am the Ghost of Christmas Present,” said the Spirit. “Look upon me!”<br><br>“我是圣诞节的精灵，”精灵说，“看着我！”<br><br><br><br>Scrooge reverently did so. It was clothed in one simple green robe, or mantle, bordered with white fur. This garment hung so loosely on the figure, that its capacious breast was bare, as if disdaining to be warded or concealed by any artifice. Its feet, observable beneath the ample folds of the garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no other covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining icicles. Its dark brown curls were long and free; free as its genial face, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice, its unconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air. Girded round its middle was an antique scabbard; but no sword was in it, and the ancient sheath was eaten up with rust.<br><br>Scrooge 虔诚地照做了。它穿着一件简单的绿色长袍，或称为斗篷，边缘饰有白色毛皮。这件衣服在身形上挂得如此宽松，以至于它的宽阔胸膛裸露出来，仿佛不屑于被任何装饰所遮挡或隐藏。它的双脚，在衣服宽大的褶皱下可见，也是赤裸的；它的头上除了一个点缀着闪亮冰晶的冬青花环外，没有其他遮盖物。它那深棕色的卷发又长又自由；自由得如同它亲切的面容、明亮的眼睛、张开的手、欢快的嗓音、无拘无束的风度和它快乐的气质。它的腰间围着一把古旧的剑鞘；但里面没有剑，那古老的剑鞘已被锈蚀得不成样子。<br><br><br><br>Scrooge’s Third Visitor “You have never seen the like of me before!” exclaimed the Spirit.<br><br>Scrooge 的第三位访客“你以前从未见过像我这样的人！”幽灵惊呼。<br><br><br><br>“Never,” Scrooge made answer to it.<br><br>“从未，”斯克鲁奇回答道。<br><br><br><br>“Have never walked forth with the younger members of my family; meaning (for I am very young) my elder brothers born in these later years?” pursued the Phantom.<br><br>“我从未和家里年轻的人一起出去过；我的意思是（因为我很年轻）指我那些出生在近年来的哥哥们？”幽灵追问。<br><br><br><br>“I don’t think I have,” said Scrooge. “I am afraid I have not. Have you had many brothers, Spirit?”<br><br>“我不认为我有过，”斯克鲁奇说。“我恐怕没有。你有很多兄弟，精灵吗？”<br><br><br><br>“More than eighteen hundred,” said the Ghost.<br><br>“一千八百多，”鬼魂说。<br><br><br><br>“A tremendous family to provide for!” muttered Scrooge.<br><br>“要养活这样一个大家族！”斯克鲁奇咕哝着。<br><br><br><br>The Ghost of Christmas Present rose.<br><br>圣诞老人的鬼魂站了起来。<br><br><br><br>“Spirit,” said Scrooge submissively, “conduct me where you will. I went forth last night on compulsion, and I learnt a lesson which is working now. To-night, if you have aught to teach me, let me profit by it.”<br><br>“精神，”斯克鲁奇顺从地说，“你把我带到哪里都行。我昨晚是被强迫出去的，我学到了一个正在起作用的教训。今晚，如果你有什么要教我的，让我从中受益。”<br><br><br><br>“Touch my robe!” “摸摸我的袍子！”<br><br><br><br>Scrooge did as he was told, and held it fast.<br><br>Scrooge 照吩咐做了，紧紧抓住。<br><br><br><br>Holly, mistletoe, red berries, ivy, turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn, meat, pigs, sausages, oysters, pies, puddings, fruit, and punch, all vanished instantly. So did the room, the fire, the ruddy glow, the hour of night, and they stood in the city streets on Christmas morning, where (for the weather was severe) the people made a rough, but brisk and not unpleasant kind of music, in scraping the snow from the pavement in front of their dwellings, and from the tops of their houses, whence it was mad delight to the boys to see it come plumping down into the road below, and splitting into artificial little snow-storms.<br><br>霍利、寄生、红浆果、常春藤、火鸡、鹅、猎物、家禽、牛肉、肉、猪、香肠、牡蛎、馅饼、布丁、水果和鸡尾酒，瞬间消失得无影无踪。房间、火、红润的光芒、夜晚的时间也随之消失，他们站在圣诞早晨的城市街道上，那里（因为天气严寒）人们发出粗糙但活泼且并不令人不快的音乐，他们在清除住宅前的人行道和屋顶上的雪，对男孩们来说，看到雪噗通通地落在下面的路上，分裂成人工的小雪暴，是一种狂喜。<br><br><br><br>The house fronts looked black enough, and the windows blacker, contrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow upon the roofs, and with the dirtier snow upon the ground; which last deposit had been ploughed up in deep furrows by the heavy wheels of carts and waggons; furrows that crossed and re-crossed each other hundreds of times where the great streets branched off; and made intricate channels, hard to trace in the thick yellow mud and icy water. The sky was gloomy, and the shortest streets were choked up with a dingy mist, half thawed, half frozen, whose heavier particles descended in a shower of sooty atoms, as if all the chimneys in Great Britain had, by one consent, caught fire, and were blazing away to their dear hearts’ content. There was nothing very cheerful in the climate or the town, and yet was there an air of cheerfulness abroad that the clearest summer air and brightest summer sun might have endeavoured to diffuse in vain.<br><br>房屋正面看起来足够黑，窗户更黑，与屋顶上光滑的白色雪片形成鲜明对比，与地面上更脏的雪形成对比；后者被马车和货车的重轮深深犁出，形成深深的沟壑；这些沟壑在街道分支处交叉和重新交叉数百次；在厚厚的黄色泥浆和冰水中形成了复杂的渠道，难以追踪。天空阴沉，最短的街道被污浊的雾气堵塞，半融半冻，其较重的颗粒以煤烟状原子雨的形式降落，仿佛大不列颠的所有烟囱都一致着火，正在熊熊燃烧，以满足他们亲爱的心满意足。气候或城镇中没有什么特别愉快的地方，然而有一种愉快的气息弥漫在外，即使是最清澈的夏日空气和最明亮的夏日阳光也试图徒劳地传播。<br><br><br><br>For, the people who were shovelling away on the housetops were jovial and full of glee; calling out to one another from the parapets, and now and then exchanging a facetious snowball—better-natured missile far than many a wordy jest—laughing heartily if it went right and not less heartily if it went wrong. The poulterers’ shops were still half open, and the fruiterers’ were radiant in their glory. There were great, round, pot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like the waistcoats of jolly old gentlemen, lolling at the doors, and tumbling out into the street in their apoplectic opulence. There were ruddy, brown-faced, broad-girthed Spanish Onions, shining in the fatness of their growth like Spanish Friars, and winking from their shelves in wanton slyness at the girls as they went by, and glanced demurely at the hung-up mistletoe. There were pears and apples, clustered high in blooming pyramids; there were bunches of grapes, made, in the shopkeepers’ benevolence to dangle from conspicuous hooks, that people’s mouths might water gratis as they passed; there were piles of filberts, mossy and brown, recalling, in their fragrance, ancient walks among the woods, and pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered leaves; there were Norfolk Biffins, squat and swarthy, setting off the yellow of the oranges and lemons, and, in the great compactness of their juicy persons, urgently entreating and beseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after dinner. The very gold and silver fish, set forth among these choice fruits in a bowl, though members of a dull and stagnant-blooded race, appeared to know that there was something going on; and, to a fish, went gasping round and round their little world in slow and passionless excitement.<br><br>屋顶上铲雪的人们欢快而充满喜悦；从防波堤上互相呼唤，不时交换一个玩笑的雪球——比许多冗长的玩笑更有好意——如果球打中了，他们会开心地大笑，如果没打中，他们也不会少笑。禽肉店还开着半扇门，水果店则光彩夺目。有巨大的、圆滚滚的栗子篮子，形状像快乐老先生的背心，懒洋洋地放在门口，它们的丰富肥美从门里倾泻到街上。还有红扑扑、棕色的、腰围粗壮的西班牙洋葱，在生长的肥美中闪耀，像西班牙僧侣一样，在她们经过时顽皮地眨眼，对挂着的槲寄生则端庄地瞥了一眼。 梨子和苹果堆叠在盛开的金字塔形花丛中；一串串葡萄，在店主们的慷慨下，悬挂在显眼的钩子上，让人路过时免费垂涎；还有堆堆的榛子，灰褐色，散发着香气，让人回忆起在树林中古老的漫步，以及脚踝深处踏过枯叶的愉快摇晃；诺福克比芬苹果，矮胖而黝黑，衬托出橙子和柠檬的黄色，它们那紧实的多汁身体，急切地恳求被装进纸袋带回家，饭后享用。在这些精选水果中，金鱼和银鱼虽然属于一个迟钝和血液停滞的种族，却似乎知道有些事情正在发生；对于鱼来说，它们在小小的世界中缓慢而冷漠地游来游去，气喘吁吁。<br><br><br><br>The Grocers’! oh, the Grocers’! nearly closed, with perhaps two shutters down, or one; but through those gaps such glimpses! It was not alone that the scales descending on the counter made a merry sound, or that the twine and roller parted company so briskly, or that the canisters were rattled up and down like juggling tricks, or even that the blended scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose, or even that the raisins were so plentiful and rare, the almonds so extremely white, the sticks of cinnamon so long and straight, the other spices so delicious, the candied fruits so caked and spotted with molten sugar as to make the coldest lookers-on feel faint and subsequently bilious. Nor was it that the figs were moist and pulpy, or that the French plums blushed in modest tartness from their highly-decorated boxes, or that everything was good to eat and in its Christmas dress; but the customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful promise of the day, that they tumbled up against each other at the door, crashing their wicker baskets wildly, and left their purchases upon the counter, and came running back to fetch them, and committed hundreds of the like mistakes, in the best humour possible; while the Grocer and his people were so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which they fastened their aprons behind might have been their own, worn outside for general inspection, and for Christmas daws to peck at if they chose.<br><br>杂货店啊！哦，杂货店！几乎要关门了，可能有两扇窗户关上，或者一扇；但透过那些缝隙，这样的景象！不仅仅是柜台上的秤砣落下发出欢快的声响，或者是线轴和卷筒如此迅速地分开，或者是罐子像魔术表演一样上下摇晃，甚至是茶和咖啡的混合香气如此令人愉悦，或者是葡萄干如此丰富而罕见，杏仁如此极其洁白，肉桂棒如此又长又直，其他香料如此美味，糖果水果被熔化的糖粘得结块和斑驳，以至于让最冷漠的旁观者都感到头晕目眩，随后还感到恶心。 也不是无花果湿润多汁，也不是法国李子因精致包装而显得羞涩微酸，也不是一切食物都美味可口，都穿着圣诞盛装；但顾客们因为对这一天的希望如此急切，以至于他们在门口互相撞倒，疯狂地撞翻他们的柳条篮子，把购买的物品留在柜台上，然后跑回来取，犯下了数百个类似的错误，却都保持着最好的心情；而杂货商和他的员工们如此坦诚和新鲜，他们系在围裙后面的光滑心形纽扣可能就是他们自己的，在外面供人检查，如果他们愿意，圣诞乌鸦也可以啄食。<br><br><br><br>But soon the steeples called good people all, to church and chapel, and away they came, flocking through the streets in their best clothes, and with their gayest faces. And at the same time there emerged from scores of bye-streets, lanes, and nameless turnings, innumerable people, carrying their dinners to the bakers’ shops. The sight of these poor revellers appeared to interest the Spirit very much, for he stood with Scrooge beside him in a baker’s doorway, and taking off the covers as their bearers passed, sprinkled incense on their dinners from his torch. And it was a very uncommon kind of torch, for once or twice when there were angry words between some dinner-carriers who had jostled each other, he shed a few drops of water on them from it, and their good humour was restored directly. For they said, it was a shame to quarrel upon Christmas Day. And so it was! God love it, so it was!<br><br>不久，尖塔召唤着善良的人们前往教堂和礼拜堂，他们身着盛装，面带笑容，成群结队地穿过街道。与此同时，从数十条小巷、弄堂和不知名的小路上，无数的人们拿着他们的午餐前往面包店。这些穷困的狂欢者似乎引起了精灵极大的兴趣，因为他站在斯克鲁奇身边，站在面包店的门口，当他们的搬运者经过时，从他的火炬上洒下香火。而且那是一种非常罕见的火炬，因为当一些搬运午餐的人因为互相推搡而发生争吵时，他曾经从上面洒下几滴水，他们的好心情立刻就恢复了。因为他们说，在圣诞节争吵是件羞耻的事情。确实如此！上帝保佑，确实如此！<br><br><br><br>In time the bells ceased, and the bakers were shut up; and yet there was a genial shadowing forth of all these dinners and the progress of their cooking, in the thawed blotch of wet above each baker’s oven; where the pavement smoked as if its stones were cooking too.<br><br>随着时间的推移，钟声停止了，面包店也关门了；然而，在每家面包店的烤箱上方，在融化的湿迹中，都可以看到所有这些午餐和烹饪的进展，人行道上冒烟，仿佛石头也在烹饪一样。<br><br><br><br>“Is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from your torch?” asked Scrooge.<br><br>“你在火把上撒的是什么，有没有什么特别的味道？”斯克鲁奇问道。<br><br><br><br>“There is. My own.” “有。是我的。”<br><br><br><br>“Would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day?” asked Scrooge.<br><br>“这种味道适用于这一天任何晚餐吗？”斯克鲁奇又问。<br><br><br><br>“To any kindly given. To a poor one most.”<br><br>任何慷慨给予的。给予贫穷者最多。<br><br><br><br>“Why to a poor one most?” asked Scrooge.<br><br>“为什么最穷的那个？”斯克鲁奇问道。<br><br><br><br>“Because it needs it most.”<br><br>因为它最需要。<br><br><br><br>“Spirit,” said Scrooge, after a moment’s thought, “I wonder you, of all the beings in the many worlds about us, should desire to cramp these people’s opportunities of innocent enjoyment.”<br><br>“精神，”斯克鲁奇想了一会儿说，“我奇怪，在我们周围众多世界中，你为何要剥夺这些人享受无辜乐趣的机会。”<br><br><br><br>“I!” cried the Spirit. “我！”精灵喊道。<br><br><br><br>“You would deprive them of their means of dining every seventh day, often the only day on which they can be said to dine at all,” said Scrooge. “Wouldn’t you?”<br><br>“我！”精灵喊道。 “你将剥夺他们每第七天用餐的手段，而这一天往往是他们唯一可以真正用餐的日子，”斯克鲁奇说。“不是吗？”<br><br><br><br>“I!” cried the Spirit. “我！”精灵喊道。<br><br><br><br>“You seek to close these places on the Seventh Day?” said Scrooge. “And it comes to the same thing.”<br><br>“你想要在第七天关闭这些地方？”斯克鲁奇说，“结果都是一样的。”<br><br><br><br>“ I seek!” exclaimed the Spirit.<br><br>“我寻求！”精灵惊呼。<br><br><br><br>“Forgive me if I am wrong. It has been done in your name, or at least in that of your family,” said Scrooge.<br><br>“如果我说错了，请原谅我。这是以你的名义做的，至少是以你家族的名义，”斯克鲁奇说。<br><br><br><br>“There are some upon this earth of yours,” returned the Spirit, “who lay claim to know us, and who do their deeds of passion, pride, ill-will, hatred, envy, bigotry, and selfishness in our name, who are as strange to us and all our kith and kin, as if they had never lived. Remember that, and charge their doings on themselves, not us.”<br><br>“在这个世界上，”精灵回答，“有一些人声称认识我们，他们以激情、骄傲、恶意、仇恨、嫉妒、偏见和自私的名义行事，对我们以及我们的亲朋好友都感到陌生，仿佛他们从未存在过。记住这一点，将他们的行为归咎于他们自己，而不是我们。”<br><br><br><br>Scrooge promised that he would; and they went on, invisible, as they had been before, into the suburbs of the town. It was a remarkable quality of the Ghost (which Scrooge had observed at the baker’s), that notwithstanding his gigantic size, he could accommodate himself to any place with ease; and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as gracefully and like a supernatural creature, as it was possible he could have done in any lofty hall.<br><br>Scrooge 承诺他会这么做；他们继续前进，就像之前一样，无形地进入了城镇的郊区。幽灵（Scrooge 在面包师傅那里观察到的）有一个非凡的品质，尽管他体型巨大，但他可以轻松地适应任何地方；他在低矮的屋顶下，就像一个超自然生物，优雅地站立，就像他在任何高大的大厅里所能做到的那样。<br><br><br><br>And perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in showing off this power of his, or else it was his own kind, generous, hearty nature, and his sympathy with all poor men, that led him straight to Scrooge’s clerk’s; for there he went, and took Scrooge with him, holding to his robe; and on the threshold of the door the Spirit smiled, and stopped to bless Bob Cratchit’s dwelling with the sprinkling of his torch. Think of that! Bob had but fifteen “Bob” a-week himself; he pocketed on Saturdays but fifteen copies of his Christian name; and yet the Ghost of Christmas Present blessed his four-roomed house!<br><br>或许这是善良的幽灵展示这种能力的乐趣，或者这只是他自己的善良、慷慨、热情的天性，以及他对所有穷人的同情，让他直接来到了 Scrooge 的职员那里；因为他就这么走了，带着 Scrooge，紧紧抓住他的长袍；在门廊上，幽灵微笑着停下来，用他的火炬为 Bob Cratchit 的住所祝福。想想看！Bob 自己每周只有十五个“Bob”；他只在周六把他的名字存入口袋，只有十五份；然而，圣诞老人的幽灵却祝福了他的四室之家！<br><br><br><br>Then up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit’s wife, dressed out but poorly in a twice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons, which are cheap and make a goodly show for sixpence; and she laid the cloth, assisted by Belinda Cratchit, second of her daughters, also brave in ribbons; while Master Peter Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and getting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar (Bob’s private property, conferred upon his son and heir in honour of the day) into his mouth, rejoiced to find himself so gallantly attired, and yearned to show his linen in the fashionable Parks. And now two smaller Cratchits, boy and girl, came tearing in, screaming that outside the baker’s they had smelt the goose, and known it for their own; and basking in luxurious thoughts of sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced about the table, and exalted Master Peter Cratchit to the skies, while he (not proud, although his collars nearly choked him) blew the fire, until the slow potatoes bubbling up, knocked loudly at the saucepan-lid to be let out and peeled.<br><br>然后，克拉奇特的妻子，克拉奇特的妻子，穿着一件翻新的长袍，虽然破旧但打扮得很漂亮，在丝带上显得勇敢，这些丝带便宜且六便士就能做出很好的展示；她在贝琳达·克拉奇特的帮助下铺上桌布，贝琳达是她的第二个女儿，也戴着丝带；而彼得·克拉奇特少爷则把叉子插进土豆炖锅，把衬衫领子（鲍勃的私人财产，授予他的儿子和继承人，以纪念这一天）的角塞进嘴里，高兴地发现自己如此英勇地打扮，渴望在时尚的公园里展示他的亚麻布。现在，两个更小的克拉奇特，男孩和女孩，冲进来，尖叫着说在面包店外面闻到了鹅的味道，知道那是他们自己的；这些年轻的克拉奇特沉浸在奢华的洋葱和香草的思绪中，在桌子周围跳舞，把彼得·克拉奇特少爷捧上了天，而他却（虽然领子几乎让他窒息，但他并不骄傲）吹着火，直到慢炖的土豆沸腾起来，猛烈地敲打着锅盖，想要出来并剥皮。<br><br><br><br>“What has ever got your precious father then?” said Mrs. Cratchit. “And your brother, Tiny Tim! And Martha warn’t as late last Christmas Day by half-an-hour?”<br><br>“那么，是什么让你宝贵的父亲陷入困境？”克雷奇特夫人问，“还有你的弟弟，蒂尼·蒂姆！还有玛莎，去年圣诞节那天不是晚了一个半小时吗？”<br><br><br><br>“Here’s Martha, mother!” said a girl, appearing as she spoke.<br><br><br><br>“Here’s Martha, mother!” cried the two young Cratchits. “Hurrah! There’s such a goose, Martha!”<br><br><br><br>“Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are!” said Mrs. Cratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off her shawl and bonnet for her with officious zeal.<br><br>哎呀，亲爱的，你来得真晚，愿上帝保佑你的心永远年轻！”克拉斯契特太太一边说着，一边吻了她十二次，热心地帮她脱下披肩和帽子。<br><br><br><br>“We’d a deal of work to finish up last night,” replied the girl, “and had to clear away this morning, mother!”<br><br>“昨晚我们还有很多工作要做，”女孩回答道，“今天早上还得清理，妈妈！”<br><br><br><br>“Well! Never mind so long as you are come,” said Mrs. Cratchit. “Sit ye down before the fire, my dear, and have a warm, Lord bless ye!”<br><br>“嗯！只要你们来了就好，”克拉斯契特太太说。“亲爱的，坐在火炉前，暖和一点，愿主保佑你！”<br><br><br><br>“No, no! There’s father coming,” cried the two young Cratchits, who were everywhere at once. “Hide, Martha, hide!”<br><br>“不，不！爸爸来了，”两个年轻的克拉斯契特同时喊道。“玛莎，躲起来，躲起来！”<br><br><br><br>So Martha hid herself, and in came little Bob, the father, with at least three feet of comforter exclusive of the fringe, hanging down before him; and his threadbare clothes darned up and brushed, to look seasonable; and Tiny Tim upon his shoulder. Alas for Tiny Tim, he bore a little crutch, and had his limbs supported by an iron frame!<br><br>所以玛莎躲了起来，小鲍勃，也就是父亲，带着至少三英尺的毯子，除了边缘外，在他面前垂下；他的破旧衣服修补过并刷过，看起来很合时宜；还有蒂尼·蒂姆在他的肩膀上。哎呀，可怜的蒂尼·蒂姆，他拄着一个小拐杖，四肢由一个铁架支撑！<br><br><br><br>“Why, where’s our Martha?” cried Bob Cratchit, looking round.<br><br><br><br>“Not coming,” said Mrs. Cratchit.<br><br>“哎呀，我们的玛莎在哪里？”鲍勃·克雷奇特喊道，四处张望。 “她不会来了，”克雷奇特太太说。<br><br><br><br>“Not coming!” said Bob, with a sudden declension in his high spirits; for he had been Tim’s blood horse all the way from church, and had come home rampant. “Not coming upon Christmas Day!”<br><br>“不来！”鲍勃说着，突然情绪低落；因为他从教堂开始就是蒂姆的“血马”，回到家后还是那么狂暴。“圣诞节那天也不来！”<br><br><br><br>Martha didn’t like to see him disappointed, if it were only in joke; so she came out prematurely from behind the closet door, and ran into his arms, while the two young Cratchits hustled Tiny Tim, and bore him off into the wash-house, that he might hear the pudding singing in the copper.<br><br>玛莎不喜欢看到他失望，哪怕只是玩笑；所以她提前从衣柜门后出来，投入他的怀抱，而两个年轻的克雷奇特把小蒂姆匆匆带走，带到洗漱间，让他能听到铜壶里布丁的歌声。<br><br><br><br>“And how did little Tim behave?” asked Mrs. Cratchit, when she had rallied Bob on his credulity, and Bob had hugged his daughter to his heart’s content.<br><br>“小蒂姆表现得怎么样？”克雷奇特太太在责备鲍勃轻信之后，鲍勃把女儿紧紧搂在怀里时问道。<br><br><br><br>“As good as gold,” said Bob, “and better. Somehow he gets thoughtful, sitting by himself so much, and thinks the strangest things you ever heard. He told me, coming home, that he hoped the people saw him in the church, because he was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to remember upon Christmas Day, who made lame beggars walk, and blind men see.”<br><br>“金光闪闪，”鲍勃说，“而且更好。不知怎么的，他一个人坐久了，就会变得沉思，想些你从未听过的奇怪事情。他告诉我，回家的路上，他希望人们看到他在教堂里，因为他是个瘸子，圣诞节那天，他们可能会很高兴想起是哪个让跛脚的乞丐能走路，让盲人能看见。”<br><br><br><br>Bob’s voice was tremulous when he told them this, and trembled more when he said that Tiny Tim was growing strong and hearty.<br><br><br><br>His active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back came Tiny Tim before another word was spoken, escorted by his brother and sister to his stool before the fire; and while Bob, turning up his cuffs—as if, poor fellow, they were capable of being made more shabby—compounded some hot mixture in a jug with gin and lemons, and stirred it round and round and put it on the hob to simmer; Master Peter, and the two ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the goose, with which they soon returned in high procession.<br><br>鲍勃说这些时声音颤抖，当他提到蒂尼·蒂姆正在变得强壮和健康时，颤抖得更厉害。 他的小拐杖在地板上发出响声，还没等再说一句话，蒂尼·蒂姆就回来了，由他的哥哥和姐姐陪着他来到火炉前的凳子前；鲍勃卷起袖子——好像这个可怜的家伙，袖子还能变得更破旧似的——在一个桶里混合了一些热混合物，加了杜松子酒和柠檬，不停地搅拌，然后放在炉子上慢慢炖；彼得先生和两个无处不在的年轻克拉奇特去了 fetch the goose，很快他们就带着鹅回来了，排着长长的队伍。<br><br><br><br>Such a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose the rarest of all birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a black swan was a matter of course—and in truth it was something very like it in that house. Mrs. Cratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing hot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour; Miss Belinda sweetened up the apple-sauce; Martha dusted the hot plates; Bob took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table; the two young Cratchits set chairs for everybody, not forgetting themselves, and mounting guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped. At last the dishes were set on, and grace was said. It was succeeded by a breathless pause, as Mrs. Cratchit, looking slowly all along the carving-knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast; but when she did, and when the long expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of delight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two young Cratchits, beat on the table with the handle of his knife, and feebly cried Hurrah!<br><br>随之而来的是一片喧嚣，你可能会以为鹅是所有鸟类中最稀有的；一种羽毛现象，黑天鹅对此习以为常——事实上，在那个家里，它确实与黑天鹅非常相似。克拉斯奇特太太把肉汁（事先在小平底锅里准备好）煮得嘶嘶作响；彼得少爷用惊人的力量把土豆捣碎；贝琳达小姐把苹果酱调甜；玛莎擦热盘子；鲍勃把小蒂姆带在身边，坐在桌子的一角；两个年轻克拉斯奇特为每个人摆椅子，没有忘记自己，站在岗位上，把勺子塞进嘴里，以免在他们轮到被帮助之前尖叫着要鹅。最后，盘子摆上了，感恩祈祷被说。随后是一片紧张的沉默，克拉斯奇特太太慢慢地看着切肉刀，准备把它插进胸肉；但是当她这么做的时候，当期待已久的馅料喷涌而出时，整个餐桌上升起了一阵欢呼声，甚至连小蒂姆也被两个年轻克拉斯奇特激动了，他用刀柄敲打桌子，虚弱地喊道：“万岁！”<br><br><br><br>There never was such a goose. Bob said he didn’t believe there ever was such a goose cooked. Its tenderness and flavour, size and cheapness, were the themes of universal admiration. Eked out by apple-sauce and mashed potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family; indeed, as Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small atom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn’t ate it all at last! Yet every one had had enough, and the youngest Cratchits in particular, were steeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows! But now, the plates being changed by Miss Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone—too nervous to bear witnesses—to take the pudding up and bring it in.<br><br>从未有过这样的鹅。鲍勃说他不相信曾经有过这样一只煮熟的鹅。它的嫩滑、味道、大小和价格，都是众人赞不绝口的主题。用苹果酱和土豆泥来搭配，它足够全家人享用一顿丰盛的晚餐；事实上，正如克拉奇特太太高兴地说的（她看着盘子上的一小块骨头），他们最后并没有吃完！然而每个人都吃得很饱，尤其是最小的克拉奇特一家，他们的眉毛都沾满了香葱和罗勒！但现在，贝琳达小姐换掉了盘子，克拉奇特太太独自离开房间——太过紧张，不愿成为目击者——去拿甜点和端进来。<br><br><br><br>Suppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should break in turning out! Suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the back-yard, and stolen it, while they were merry with the goose—a supposition at which the two young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were supposed.<br><br>要是煮得不够熟呢！要是倒出来的时候碎了！要是有人翻过后院的墙，偷走了它，而他们还在开心地享用鹅——这个假设让两个年轻克拉奇特变得脸色铁青！想出了各种各样的恐怖情景。<br><br><br><br>Hallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper. A smell like a washing-day! That was the cloth. A smell like an eating-house and a pastrycook’s next door to each other, with a laundress’s next door to that! That was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit entered—flushed, but smiling proudly—with the pudding, like a speckled cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of half-a-quartern of ignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top.<br><br><br><br>Oh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly too, that he regarded it as the greatest success achieved by Mrs. Cratchit since their marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that now the weight was off her mind, she would confess she had had her doubts about the quantity of flour. Everybody had something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it was at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have been flat heresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a thing.<br><br><br><br>At last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth swept, and the fire made up. The compound in the jug being tasted, and considered perfect, apples and oranges were put upon the table, and a shovel-full of chestnuts on the fire. Then all the Cratchit family drew round the hearth, in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half a one; and at Bob Cratchit’s elbow stood the family display of glass. Two tumblers, and a custard-cup without a handle.<br><br>最后晚餐准备好了，桌布清理干净，壁炉打扫完毕，火也生好了。壶里的酒尝过，被认为完美，苹果和橙子摆上了桌子，炉火中放了一铲栗子。然后，克雷奇特一家都围在壁炉旁，鲍勃·克雷奇特称之为一个圈，意思是半个圈；鲍勃·克雷奇特胳膊肘旁边是全家展示的玻璃器皿。两个玻璃杯，一个没有把手的奶油杯。<br><br><br><br>These held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as golden goblets would have done; and Bob served it out with beaming looks, while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily. Then Bob proposed:<br><br>然而，这些容器装着壶里的热酒，就像金酒杯一样；鲍勃面带笑容地分发着，炉火中的栗子噼啪作响。然后鲍勃提议：<br><br><br><br>“A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!”<br><br>“亲爱的们，祝我们圣诞快乐。愿上帝保佑我们！”<br><br><br><br>Which all the family re-echoed.<br><br>所有家人都跟着重复。<br><br><br><br>“God bless us every one!” said Tiny Tim, the last of all.<br><br>“愿上帝保佑我们每一个人！”小蒂姆，最后一个说。<br><br><br><br>He sat very close to his father’s side upon his little stool. Bob held his withered little hand in his, as if he loved the child, and wished to keep him by his side, and dreaded that he might be taken from him.<br><br>他坐在他父亲身边的小凳子上。鲍勃握着他枯萎的小手，仿佛他爱这个孩子，希望他能留在身边，又害怕他会被人从他身边带走。<br><br><br><br>“Spirit,” said Scrooge, with an interest he had never felt before, “tell me if Tiny Tim will live.”<br><br>“精灵，”斯克鲁奇带着他以前从未有过的兴趣说，“告诉我，小蒂姆会活下来吗？”<br><br><br><br>“I see a vacant seat,” replied the Ghost, “in the poor chimney-corner, and a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved. If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, the child will die.”<br><br>“我看到一个空座位，”幽灵回答说，“在穷人的烟囱角落里，还有一根没有主人的拐杖，被小心地保存着。如果这些影子在未来没有改变，这个孩子将会死去。”<br><br><br><br>“No, no,” said Scrooge. “Oh, no, kind Spirit! say he will be spared.”<br><br>“不，不，”斯克鲁奇说。“哦，不，仁慈的精灵！请说他会得到赦免。”<br><br><br><br>“If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, none other of my race,” returned the Ghost, “will find him here. What then? If he be like to die, he had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.”<br><br>如果这些阴影在未来保持不变，我的同类中无人会在这里找到他。那又如何？如果他注定要死，他最好去死，减少过剩的人口。<br><br><br><br>Scrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the Spirit, and was overcome with penitence and grief.<br><br><br><br>“Man,” said the Ghost, “if man you be in heart, not adamant, forbear that wicked cant until you have discovered What the surplus is, and Where it is. Will you decide what men shall live, what men shall die? It may be, that in the sight of Heaven, you are more worthless and less fit to live than millions like this poor man’s child. Oh God! to hear the Insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry brothers in the dust!”<br><br>斯克鲁奇低下头，听到幽灵重复他的话，心中充满了悔恨和悲伤。 “人啊，”幽灵说，“如果你内心是人的心，而不是铁石心肠，那么在你发现什么是过剩，以及它在何处之前，不要说出那邪恶的空话。你将决定谁应该活着，谁应该死去吗？也许在上帝的眼中，你比这个可怜人孩子的百万倍还要无价值和不适于生存。哦，上帝！听到树叶上的昆虫在评判尘土中饥饿的兄弟们之间过多的生命！”<br><br><br><br>Scrooge bent before the Ghost’s rebuke, and trembling cast his eyes upon the ground. But he raised them speedily, on hearing his own name.<br><br><br><br>“Mr. Scrooge!” said Bob; “I’ll give you Mr. Scrooge, the Founder of the Feast!”<br><br><br><br>“The Founder of the Feast indeed!” cried Mrs. Cratchit, reddening. “I wish I had him here. I’d give him a piece of my mind to feast upon, and I hope he’d have a good appetite for it.”<br><br><br><br>“My dear,” said Bob, “the children! Christmas Day.”<br><br>“亲爱的，”鲍勃说，“孩子们！圣诞节。”<br><br><br><br>“It should be Christmas Day, I am sure,” said she, “on which one drinks the health of such an odious, stingy, hard, unfeeling man as Mr. Scrooge. You know he is, Robert! Nobody knows it better than you do, poor fellow!”<br><br>“我确信那应该是圣诞节，”她说，“在这一天，人们会为这样一个令人厌恶、吝啬、冷酷、无情的人，斯克鲁奇先生，干杯。你知道他是，罗伯特！没有人比你更清楚，可怜的家伙！”<br><br><br><br>“My dear,” was Bob’s mild answer, “Christmas Day.”<br><br>“亲爱的，”鲍勃温和地回答，“圣诞节。”<br><br><br><br>“I’ll drink his health for your sake and the Day’s,” said Mrs. Cratchit, “not for his. Long life to him! A merry Christmas and a happy new year! He’ll be very merry and very happy, I have no doubt!”<br><br>我将为你的输入进行翻译：<br><br><br><br>The children drank the toast after her. It was the first of their proceedings which had no heartiness. Tiny Tim drank it last of all, but he didn’t care twopence for it. Scrooge was the Ogre of the family. The mention of his name cast a dark shadow on the party, which was not dispelled for full five minutes.<br><br>“为了你的健康和这个美好的日子，我要为他干杯，”克雷奇特太太说，“而不是为他自己。愿他长寿！圣诞快乐，新年快乐！我相信他会非常快乐和幸福的！” 孩子们在她之后举杯。这是他们活动中第一次没有热情。小蒂姆最后喝杯，但他对此毫不在意。斯克鲁奇是这个家庭的怪物。提到他的名字，让整个聚会笼罩在一片黑暗中，这种情绪持续了整整五分钟。<br><br><br><br>After it had passed away, they were ten times merrier than before, from the mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done with. Bob Cratchit told them how he had a situation in his eye for Master Peter, which would bring in, if obtained, full five-and-sixpence weekly. The two young Cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of Peter’s being a man of business; and Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from between his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular investments he should favour when he came into the receipt of that bewildering income. Martha, who was a poor apprentice at a milliner’s, then told them what kind of work she had to do, and how many hours she worked at a stretch, and how she meant to lie abed to-morrow morning for a good long rest; to-morrow being a holiday she passed at home. Also how she had seen a countess and a lord some days before, and how the lord “was much about as tall as Peter;” at which Peter pulled up his collars so high that you couldn’t have seen his head if you had been there. All this time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round; and by-and-bye they had a song, about a lost child travelling in the snow, from Tiny Tim, who had a plaintive little voice, and sang it very well indeed.<br><br>它走了之后，他们比以前快乐了十倍，仅仅是因为那个可怕的斯克鲁奇已经结束了。鲍勃·克雷奇特告诉他们，他看中了彼得先生的一个职位，如果得到的话，每周可以赚五先令六便士。两个年轻的克雷奇特对彼得是个商人这个想法大笑不止；彼得自己则从领口之间若有所思地看着火炉，好像在考虑他拿到那令人困惑的收入时应该支持哪种特定的投资。玛莎，一个在帽匠店当学徒的穷人，然后告诉他们她必须做什么工作，她一次能工作多少小时，她打算明天早上躺在床上好好休息一下；因为明天是她在家里过的假日。她还提到几天前她见过一位伯爵夫人和一位勋爵，勋爵“大概和彼得一样高”；这时彼得把领子拉得那么高，如果你在场的话，甚至看不到他的头。 这期间，栗子和水罐来回转个不停；不久，他们唱起了一首歌，关于一个在雪中旅行的失踪孩子，来自 Tiny Tim，他有一个哀伤的小声音，唱得非常好。<br><br><br><br>There was nothing of high mark in this. They were not a handsome family; they were not well dressed; their shoes were far from being water-proof; their clothes were scanty; and Peter might have known, and very likely did, the inside of a pawnbroker’s. But, they were happy, grateful, pleased with one another, and contented with the time; and when they faded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the Spirit’s torch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon them, and especially on Tiny Tim, until the last.<br><br>这没什么特别的。他们不是一个好看的家族；他们衣着不整；他们的鞋子远非防水；他们的衣服破旧；彼得可能知道，很可能确实知道当铺的内部。但是，他们是快乐的，感激的，彼此满意，对时间感到满足；当他们凋谢，在精神火炬的明亮洒落中看起来更加快乐时，Scrooge 一直注视着他们，尤其是 Tiny Tim，直到最后。<br><br><br><br>By this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty heavily; and as Scrooge and the Spirit went along the streets, the brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and all sorts of rooms, was wonderful. Here, the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a cosy dinner, with hot plates baking through and through before the fire, and deep red curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness. There all the children of the house were running out into the snow to meet their married sisters, brothers, cousins, uncles, aunts, and be the first to greet them. Here, again, were shadows on the window-blind of guests assembling; and there a group of handsome girls, all hooded and fur-booted, and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near neighbour’s house; where, woe upon the single man who saw them enter—artful witches, well they knew it—in a glow!<br><br>这时天色已晚，雪下得很大；随着斯克鲁奇和精灵沿着街道前行，厨房、客厅和各种房间里熊熊燃烧的火光非常耀眼。这里，火焰的闪烁显示出准备一顿舒适的晚餐，热盘子在火前烤得透透的，还有深红色的窗帘，准备拉上以挡住寒冷和黑暗。这里，全家的孩子们都跑出去迎接他们的已婚姐妹、兄弟、堂兄弟姐妹、叔叔、阿姨，成为第一个向他们问候的人。这里，窗帘上出现了客人聚集的阴影；那里，一群漂亮的女孩，都戴着风帽，穿着皮靴，同时喋喋不休，轻盈地跳向附近邻居的家；唉，任何看到他们进入的单身男人都会倒霉——她们是狡猾的女巫，这一点她们很清楚——在火光中！<br><br><br><br>But, if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to friendly gatherings, you might have thought that no one was at home to give them welcome when they got there, instead of every house expecting company, and piling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how the Ghost exulted! How it bared its breadth of breast, and opened its capacious palm, and floated on, outpouring, with a generous hand, its bright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach! The very lamplighter, who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of light, and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out loudly as the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter that he had any company but Christmas!<br><br>然而，如果你从前往友好聚会的人的数量来判断，你可能会认为当他们到达时，没有人在家迎接他们，而不是每家都在期待客人，炉火堆得半烟囱那么高。祝福它，鬼魂多么欢欣鼓舞！它敞开胸膛，张开宽大的手掌，慷慨地倾泻出它明亮而无害的快乐，洒向它所能触及的一切！甚至那个走在前面、在昏暗的街道上用灯光点缀的提灯人，虽然穿着晚礼服准备去某个地方度过夜晚，当鬼魂经过时也大声笑了起来，尽管提灯人并不知道他除了圣诞节外还有其他同伴！<br><br><br><br>And now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they stood upon a bleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast about, as though it were the burial-place of giants; and water spread itself wheresoever it listed, or would have done so, but for the frost that held it prisoner; and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse rank grass. Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery red, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a sullen eye, and frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in the thick gloom of darkest night.<br><br>现在，鬼魂没有一声警告，他们站在一片荒凉的沙漠荒原上，巨大的粗糙石头散布四周，仿佛是巨人的墓地；水随意流淌，或本会如此，但被冰霜囚禁；除了苔藓、荆棘和粗糙的杂草，什么都不生长。在西边，落日留下一道火红的条纹，瞬间照耀着荒凉之地，像一只阴郁的眼睛，皱着眉头，越来越低，最终消失在最黑暗的夜色中。<br><br><br><br>“What place is this?” asked Scrooge.<br><br>“这是什么地方？”斯克鲁奇问道。<br><br><br><br>“A place where Miners live, who labour in the bowels of the earth,” returned the Spirit. “But they know me. See!”<br><br>“一个矿工居住的地方，他们在地球的深处劳作，”精灵回答。“但他们认识我。看！”<br><br><br><br>A light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they advanced towards it. Passing through the wall of mud and stone, they found a cheerful company assembled round a glowing fire. An old, old man and woman, with their children and their children’s children, and another generation beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire. The old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind upon the barren waste, was singing them a Christmas song—it had been a very old song when he was a boy—and from time to time they all joined in the chorus. So surely as they raised their voices, the old man got quite blithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour sank again.<br><br>一束光从一间小屋的窗户透出，他们迅速朝那里走去。穿过泥土和石墙，他们发现一群人围坐在一簇熊熊燃烧的火堆旁。一位年迈的老人和一位老妇人，以及他们的孩子、孩子的孩子，还有下一代，都穿着节日的盛装，欢快地聚集在一起。老人用一种很少能超过荒凉之地狂风呼啸声的嗓音，为他们唱着一首圣诞歌曲——当他还是个孩子的时候，这首歌就已经非常古老了——时不时地，他们都会加入合唱。每当他们提高嗓门，老人的情绪就会变得非常愉快和响亮；而每当他们停下来，他的活力又会重新减弱。<br><br><br><br>The Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his robe, and passing on above the moor, sped—whither? Not to sea? To sea. To Scrooge’s horror, looking back, he saw the last of the land, a frightful range of rocks, behind them; and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water, as it rolled and roared, and raged among the dreadful caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.<br><br>精神并未在此逗留，却让斯克鲁奇停下脚步，继续前行，越过荒野，疾驰而去——去向何方？不是去海上？是去海上。斯克鲁奇惊恐地回首，看到最后一丝陆地，后面是一排可怕的岩石；他的耳朵被滚滚波涛的轰鸣声震聋，波涛在它侵蚀的可怕洞穴中滚动、咆哮、肆虐，并试图摧毁大地。<br><br><br><br>Built upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league or so from shore, on which the waters chafed and dashed, the wild year through, there stood a solitary lighthouse. Great heaps of sea-weed clung to its base, and storm-birds—born of the wind one might suppose, as sea-weed of the water—rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.<br><br>在离海岸几英里远的一个沉没岩石的凄凉礁石上，海水整年都在这里拍打、撞击，那里矗立着一座孤独的灯塔。大量的海藻附着在其底部，风暴鸟——或许可以认为它们是风的孩子，就像海藻是水的孩子一样——在周围起伏，就像它们掠过的波浪一样。<br><br><br><br>But even here, two men who watched the light had made a fire, that through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of brightness on the awful sea. Joining their horny hands over the rough table at which they sat, they wished each other Merry Christmas in their can of grog; and one of them: the elder, too, with his face all damaged and scarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship might be: struck up a sturdy song that was like a Gale in itself.<br><br>但即使在这里，两个守着灯光的男人已经生起了火，那火光透过厚厚的石墙的缝隙，投射出一束光芒，照亮了那可怕的海洋。他们坐在粗糙的桌子上，将粗糙的手放在桌上，用他们罐子里的烈酒互相祝福圣诞快乐；其中一人——年长的，脸被恶劣的天气损伤和疤痕覆盖，就像一艘老船的船首像：唱起了一首坚韧的歌曲，就像一阵狂风本身。<br><br><br><br>Again the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea—on, on—until, being far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a ship. They stood beside the helmsman at the wheel, the look-out in the bow, the officers who had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their several stations; but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or had a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his companion of some bygone Christmas Day, with homeward hopes belonging to it. And every man on board, waking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder word for another on that day than on any day in the year; and had shared to some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those he cared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted to remember him.<br><br>鬼魂再次飞快地向前，越过那片漆黑汹涌的大海——向前，向前——直到，正如他对斯克鲁奇所说的，远离任何海岸，他们降落在一艘船上。他们站在舵手旁边，在船头守望，值班军官们；他们各自岗位上的身影，阴暗而幽灵般；但每个人都在哼唱圣诞歌曲，或者心中想着圣诞节，或者在低声与同伴交谈，谈论着往昔的圣诞日，带着回家的希望。船上每个人，无论醒着还是睡着，无论好坏，在那一天对他人都比一年中的任何一天都要和善；他们都在某种程度上参与了庆祝活动；他们记得那些他们关心的人，并且知道他们也乐于记住他。<br><br><br><br>It was a great surprise to Scrooge, while listening to the moaning of the wind, and thinking what a solemn thing it was to move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown abyss, whose depths were secrets as profound as Death: it was a great surprise to Scrooge, while thus engaged, to hear a hearty laugh. It was a much greater surprise to Scrooge to recognise it as his own nephew’s and to find himself in a bright, dry, gleaming room, with the Spirit standing smiling by his side, and looking at that same nephew with approving affability!<br><br>斯克鲁奇在听着风的哀嚎，想着在这孤独的黑暗中穿越未知的深渊是多么庄严的事情，其深处如同死亡一样深邃的秘密：就在他如此专注的时候，听到一阵 hearty laugh。斯克鲁奇更惊讶的是，他认出那是他侄子的笑声，并发现自己身处一个明亮、干燥、闪耀的房间，精灵站在他身边微笑着，看着那个侄子，表情和蔼可亲！<br><br><br><br>“Ha, ha!” laughed Scrooge’s nephew. “Ha, ha, ha!”<br><br>哈哈！斯克鲁奇侄子笑着说。“哈哈哈！”<br><br><br><br>If you should happen, by any unlikely chance, to know a man more blest in a laugh than Scrooge’s nephew, all I can say is, I should like to know him too. Introduce him to me, and I’ll cultivate his acquaintance.<br><br>如果你有幸，在极不可能的情况下，认识一个比斯克鲁奇侄子更会笑的人，我只能说，我也想认识他。把他介绍给我，我会培养与他相识的。<br><br><br><br>It is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things, that while there is infection in disease and sorrow, there is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good-humour. When Scrooge’s nephew laughed in this way: holding his sides, rolling his head, and twisting his face into the most extravagant contortions: Scrooge’s niece, by marriage, laughed as heartily as he. And their assembled friends being not a bit behindhand, roared out lustily.<br><br>这是一个公正、公平、高尚的调整，尽管疾病和悲伤中存在感染，但世界上没有什么比笑声和好心情更具传染性。当斯克鲁奇的外甥这样笑时：抱着肚子，摇头晃脑，把脸扭成最夸张的扭曲：斯克鲁奇的侄女，通过婚姻，和他一样开心地笑。他们聚集的朋友们也不甘落后，大声吼叫。<br><br><br><br>“Ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha!”<br><br><br><br>“He said that Christmas was a humbug, as I live!” cried Scrooge’s nephew. “He believed it too!”<br><br>“哈哈！哈哈！哈哈！哈哈！” “他说圣诞节是个骗局，我敢发誓！”斯克鲁奇的外甥喊道。“他也这么相信！”<br><br><br><br>“More shame for him, Fred!” said Scrooge’s niece, indignantly. Bless those women; they never do anything by halves. They are always in earnest.<br><br><br><br>She was very pretty: exceedingly pretty. With a dimpled, surprised-looking, capital face; a ripe little mouth, that seemed made to be kissed—as no doubt it was; all kinds of good little dots about her chin, that melted into one another when she laughed; and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever saw in any little creature’s head. Altogether she was what you would have called provoking, you know; but satisfactory, too. Oh, perfectly satisfactory.<br><br><br><br>“He’s a comical old fellow,” said Scrooge’s nephew, “that’s the truth: and not so pleasant as he might be. However, his offences carry their own punishment, and I have nothing to say against him.”<br><br><br><br>“I’m sure he is very rich, Fred,” hinted Scrooge’s niece. “At least you always tell me so.”<br><br><br><br>“What of that, my dear!” said Scrooge’s nephew. “His wealth is of no use to him. He don’t do any good with it. He don’t make himself comfortable with it. He hasn’t the satisfaction of thinking—ha, ha, ha!—that he is ever going to benefit US with it.”<br><br>那又怎样，亲爱的！”史克鲁奇的外甥说。“他的财富对他毫无用处。他没用它做过任何好事。他也没用它让自己过得舒服。他没有那种满足感——哈哈，哈哈，哈哈！——认为他会用这笔钱来造福我们。”<br><br><br><br>“I have no patience with him,” observed Scrooge’s niece. Scrooge’s niece’s sisters, and all the other ladies, expressed the same opinion.<br><br>“我对他一点耐心都没有，”斯克鲁奇的外甥女说道。斯克鲁奇外甥女的姐妹们以及其他所有女士都表达了同样的看法。<br><br><br><br>“Oh, I have!” said Scrooge’s nephew. “I am sorry for him; I couldn’t be angry with him if I tried. Who suffers by his ill whims! Himself, always. Here, he takes it into his head to dislike us, and he won’t come and dine with us. What’s the consequence? He don’t lose much of a dinner.”<br><br>哦，我有！斯克鲁奇侄子说。“我为他的事感到抱歉；即使我尽力，我也不会生他的气。谁会因他的坏脾气而受苦！永远是他自己。这里，他突然决定不喜欢我们，不愿意和我们一起吃饭。结果是什么？他并不会失去多少顿饭。”<br><br><br><br>“Indeed, I think he loses a very good dinner,” interrupted Scrooge’s niece. Everybody else said the same, and they must be allowed to have been competent judges, because they had just had dinner; and, with the dessert upon the table, were clustered round the fire, by lamplight.<br><br>确实，我认为他错过了一顿非常好的晚餐，”斯克鲁奇的外甥打断了他的话。其他人也都这么说，他们肯定是有资格的评判者，因为他们刚刚吃过饭；而且，餐后甜点已经放在桌上，他们围坐在火炉旁，灯光下聚集在一起。<br><br><br><br>“Well! I’m very glad to hear it,” said Scrooge’s nephew, “because I haven’t great faith in these young housekeepers. What do you say, Topper?”<br><br>“我相信他非常富有，弗雷德，”斯克鲁奇侄女暗示道。“至少你总是这样告诉我。” “嗯！很高兴听到这个，”斯克鲁奇侄子说，“因为我对这些年轻的管家没有太大的信心。托珀，你怎么看？”<br><br><br><br>Topper had clearly got his eye upon one of Scrooge’s niece’s sisters, for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast, who had no right to express an opinion on the subject. Whereat Scrooge’s niece’s sister—the plump one with the lace tucker: not the one with the roses—blushed.<br><br>托珀显然看上了斯克鲁奇侄女中的一个妹妹，因为他回答说单身汉是个可怜的流浪者，没有权利对这个问题发表意见。这时，斯克鲁奇侄女中的那个丰满的妹妹——戴着蕾丝头巾的，不是那个戴玫瑰的——脸红了。<br><br><br><br>“Do go on, Fred,” said Scrooge’s niece, clapping her hands. “He never finishes what he begins to say! He is such a ridiculous fellow!”<br><br>“弗雷德，继续说吧，”斯克鲁奇侄女拍着手说，“他从来不能说完他开始说的话！他真是个滑稽的家伙！”<br><br><br><br>Scrooge’s nephew revelled in another laugh, and as it was impossible to keep the infection off; though the plump sister tried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar; his example was unanimously followed.<br><br>Scrooge 的侄子又大笑起来，尽管丰满的姐姐尽力用香醋来阻止这种传染，但他的榜样还是得到了一致效仿。<br><br><br><br>“I was only going to say,” said Scrooge’s nephew, “that the consequence of his taking a dislike to us, and not making merry with us, is, as I think, that he loses some pleasant moments, which could do him no harm. I am sure he loses pleasanter companions than he can find in his own thoughts, either in his mouldy old office, or his dusty chambers. I mean to give him the same chance every year, whether he likes it or not, for I pity him. He may rail at Christmas till he dies, but he can’t help thinking better of it—I defy him—if he finds me going there, in good temper, year after year, and saying Uncle Scrooge, how are you? If it only puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds, that’s something; and I think I shook him yesterday.”<br><br>“我只是想说，”斯克鲁奇侄子说，“他不喜欢我们，不和我们欢庆，我认为他失去了一些愉快的时光，这对他没有害处。我敢肯定，他失去的比他在自己那破旧的办公室或满是灰尘的房间里能找到的更愉快的伴侣。我打算每年都给他同样的机会，无论他是否喜欢，因为我同情他。他可以一直诅咒圣诞节直到他死，但他无法阻止自己对其产生更好的想法——我敢打赌——如果他发现我每年都带着好心情去那里，对他说，叔叔斯克鲁奇，你好吗？如果这只能让他给那个可怜的职员留下五十英镑，那也是一件好事；我想我昨天让他动摇了。”<br><br><br><br>It was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking Scrooge. But being thoroughly good-natured, and not much caring what they laughed at, so that they laughed at any rate, he encouraged them in their merriment, and passed the bottle joyously.<br><br>现在轮到他们嘲笑他摇醒斯克鲁奇的想法了。但因为他们心地善良，并不在乎他们嘲笑什么，所以无论如何他们都笑了，他鼓励他们的欢乐，并愉快地传递着酒瓶。<br><br><br><br>After tea, they had some music. For they were a musical family, and knew what they were about, when they sung a Glee or Catch, I can assure you: especially Topper, who could growl away in the bass like a good one, and never swell the large veins in his forehead, or get red in the face over it. Scrooge’s niece played well upon the harp; and played among other tunes a simple little air (a mere nothing: you might learn to whistle it in two minutes), which had been familiar to the child who fetched Scrooge from the boarding-school, as he had been reminded by the Ghost of Christmas Past. When this strain of music sounded, all the things that Ghost had shown him, came upon his mind; he softened more and more; and thought that if he could have listened to it often, years ago, he might have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands, without resorting to the sexton’s spade that buried Jacob Marley.<br><br>茶后，他们听了一些音乐。因为他们是一个音乐世家，知道自己在做什么，当他们唱《合唱曲》或《抓歌》时，我可以向你保证：尤其是托珀，他能在低音部分咆哮得像一只好狗，而从不让额头上的大血管膨胀，也不会因为这件事而脸红。斯克鲁奇的侄女在竖琴上弹得很好；在其他的曲调中，她还弹了一首简单的曲子（只是一点小事：你可以在两分钟内学会吹它），这首歌对那个从寄宿学校接斯克鲁奇的孩子来说很熟悉，因为圣诞过去之灵提醒了他。当这串音乐响起时，鬼魂曾经向他展示的所有东西都浮现在他的脑海中；他越来越温柔；他想着，如果他能经常在多年前听到它，他可能会用自己的双手培养生活的善意，以获得自己的幸福，而不必求助于埋葬雅各布·马利的看门人的铲子。<br><br><br><br>But they didn’t devote the whole evening to music. After a while they played at forfeits; for it is good to be children sometimes, and never better than at Christmas, when its mighty Founder was a child himself. Stop! There was first a game at blind-man’s buff. Of course there was. And I no more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he had eyes in his boots. My opinion is, that it was a done thing between him and Scrooge’s nephew; and that the Ghost of Christmas Present knew it. The way he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker, was an outrage on the credulity of human nature. Knocking down the fire-irons, tumbling over the chairs, bumping against the piano, smothering himself among the curtains, wherever she went, there went he! He always knew where the plump sister was. He wouldn’t catch anybody else. If you had fallen up against him (as some of them did), on purpose, he would have made a feint of endeavouring to seize you, which would have been an affront to your understanding, and would instantly have sidled off in the direction of the plump sister. She often cried out that it wasn’t fair; and it really was not. But when at last, he caught her; when, in spite of all her silken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him, he got her into a corner whence there was no escape; then his conduct was the most execrable. For his pretending not to know her; his pretending that it was necessary to touch her head-dress, and further to assure himself of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her finger, and a certain chain about her neck; was vile, monstrous! No doubt she told him her opinion of it, when, another blind-man being in office, they were so very confidential together, behind the curtains.<br><br>但他们并没有把整个晚上都花在音乐上。过了一会儿，他们开始玩惩罚游戏；因为有时候做孩子是好的，而圣诞节时更是如此，因为它的伟大创始人自己也曾是个孩子。停！首先是一局“瞎子摸鱼”。当然有。我并不相信托珀真的看不见，就像我不相信他的靴子里有眼睛一样。我的看法是，这是他和斯克鲁奇侄子的既定计划；圣诞老人的幽灵也知道这一点。他追那个戴着蕾丝头巾的丰满姐姐的样子，是对人类信任的侮辱。撞倒火钳，从椅子上摔下来，撞到钢琴上，在窗帘中窒息，无论她走到哪里，他都会跟到哪里！他总是知道丰满姐姐在哪里。他不会抓到任何人。如果你故意撞到他（就像有些人那样），他会假装试图抓住你，这会冒犯你的理解，然后立刻溜向丰满姐姐的方向。她经常大声喊不公平；确实不公平。 但他最终抓住了她；尽管她有丝绸般的摆动和从他身边快速掠过的动作，但他还是将她逼到了一个无路可逃的角落；那时他的行为是最令人憎恶的。因为他假装不认识她；假装有必要触摸她的头饰，并进一步通过在她手指上按一个戒指、在她脖子上挂一条链来确认她的身份；这是卑鄙、可憎的！毫无疑问，当另一位盲人担任职务时，他们在幕后非常亲密，她向他表达了对这件事的看法。<br><br><br><br>Scrooge’s niece was not one of the blind-man’s buff party, but was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool, in a snug corner, where the Ghost and Scrooge were close behind her. But she joined in the forfeits, and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet. Likewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was very great, and to the secret joy of Scrooge’s nephew, beat her sisters hollow: though they were sharp girls too, as Topper could have told you. There might have been twenty people there, young and old, but they all played, and so did Scrooge; for wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on, that his voice made no sound in their ears, he sometimes came out with his guess quite loud, and very often guessed quite right, too; for the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel, warranted not to cut in the eye, was not sharper than Scrooge; blunt as he took it in his head to be.<br><br>Scrooge 的侄女不是捉迷藏派对的一员，但她被安置在一个舒适的角落里，有一把大椅子和一个脚凳，鬼魂和 Scrooge 在她身后很近。但她参与了惩罚游戏，用字母表上的所有字母都爱她的爱人。同样，在“何时何地”游戏中，她也非常出色，让 Scrooge 的侄子感到无比高兴：尽管她们也是聪明的女孩，就像 Topper 可以告诉你的那样。那里可能有二十个人，年轻人和老年人，但他们都参与了游戏，Scrooge 也不例外；因为他完全忘记了他在发生的事情中的兴趣，他的声音在他们的耳朵里没有发出声音，他有时会大声说出他的猜测，而且经常猜得很对；因为最尖的针，最好的 Whitechapel，保证不会刺到眼睛，也比不上 Scrooge；他心里想得那么钝。<br><br><br><br>The Ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood, and looked upon him with such favour, that he begged like a boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed. But this the Spirit said could not be done.<br><br>鬼魂很高兴发现他处于这种心情，对他如此宠爱，以至于他像孩子一样请求被允许留下来直到客人离开。但这个精灵说这是不可能的。<br><br><br><br>“Here is a new game,” said Scrooge. “One half hour, Spirit, only one!”<br><br>“这里有一款新游戏，”斯克鲁奇说，“半小时，精灵，只有半小时！”<br><br><br><br>It was a Game called Yes and No, where Scrooge’s nephew had to think of something, and the rest must find out what; he only answering to their questions yes or no, as the case was. The brisk fire of questioning to which he was exposed, elicited from him that he was thinking of an animal, a live animal, rather a disagreeable animal, a savage animal, an animal that growled and grunted sometimes, and talked sometimes, and lived in London, and walked about the streets, and wasn’t made a show of, and wasn’t led by anybody, and didn’t live in a menagerie, and was never killed in a market, and was not a horse, or an ass, or a cow, or a bull, or a tiger, or a dog, or a pig, or a cat, or a bear. At every fresh question that was put to him, this nephew burst into a fresh roar of laughter; and was so inexpressibly tickled, that he was obliged to get up off the sofa and stamp. At last the plump sister, falling into a similar state, cried out:<br><br>这是一款名为“是与否”的游戏，斯克鲁奇的外甥需要想出一个东西，其他人必须猜出来；他只回答他们的问题，是或否，视情况而定。他面临的这种迅速的提问方式让他想到了一个动物，一个活生生的动物，相当令人不快的动物，一个野蛮的动物，有时会咆哮和咕哝，有时会说话，生活在伦敦，在大街上走来走去，没有被当作展览，没有人带领，不住在动物园里，从未在市场上被杀，不是马，驴，牛，公牛，老虎，狗，猪，猫，或熊。每当有人问他一个新问题，这个外甥就会爆发出一阵新的笑声；他如此开心，以至于不得不从沙发上站起来跺脚。最后，丰满的妹妹也陷入了类似的状态，大声喊道：<br><br><br><br>“I have found it out! I know what it is, Fred! I know what it is!”<br><br>我已经找到它了！我知道这是什么，弗雷德！我知道这是什么！<br><br><br><br>“What is it?” cried Fred.<br><br>“这是什么？”弗雷德喊道。<br><br><br><br>“It’s your Uncle Scro-o-o-o-oge!”<br><br>“是你的叔叔斯克鲁奇！”<br><br><br><br>Which it certainly was. Admiration was the universal sentiment, though some objected that the reply to “Is it a bear?” ought to have been “Yes;” inasmuch as an answer in the negative was sufficient to have diverted their thoughts from Mr. Scrooge, supposing they had ever had any tendency that way.<br><br>这确实如此。大家普遍感到钦佩，尽管有些人反对说，对于“它是熊吗？”的回答应该是“是的；”因为否定的回答已经足以让他们从斯克鲁奇先生那里转移注意力，假设他们曾经有过这样的倾向。<br><br><br><br>“He has given us plenty of merriment, I am sure,” said Fred, “and it would be ungrateful not to drink his health. Here is a glass of mulled wine ready to our hand at the moment; and I say, ‘Uncle Scrooge!’”<br><br><br><br>“Well! Uncle Scrooge!” they cried.<br><br>“我敢肯定，他给我们带来了很多欢乐，”弗雷德说，“不为他干杯是不够感激的。现在我们手边就有热红酒；我说，‘叔叔斯克鲁奇！’” “嗯！叔叔斯克鲁奇！”他们叫道。<br><br><br><br>“A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to the old man, whatever he is!” said Scrooge’s nephew. “He wouldn’t take it from me, but may he have it, nevertheless. Uncle Scrooge!”<br><br>圣诞快乐，新年快乐，愿这位老人无论怎样都如此！斯克鲁奇侄子说。“他不会从我这里接受，但愿他无论如何都能得到。斯克鲁奇叔叔！”<br><br><br><br>Uncle Scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light of heart, that he would have pledged the unconscious company in return, and thanked them in an inaudible speech, if the Ghost had given him time. But the whole scene passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his nephew; and he and the Spirit were again upon their travels.<br><br>斯克鲁奇不知不觉地变得如此快乐和心情愉快，以至于他愿意以无意识的公司作为回报，并在不可听见的讲话中向他们表示感谢，如果鬼魂给他时间的话。但整个场景在他侄子说的最后一句话的呼吸中结束；他和精灵又开始了他们的旅行。<br><br><br><br>Much they saw, and far they went, and many homes they visited, but always with a happy end. The Spirit stood beside sick beds, and they were cheerful; on foreign lands, and they were close at home; by struggling men, and they were patient in their greater hope; by poverty, and it was rich. In almshouse, hospital, and jail, in misery’s every refuge, where vain man in his little brief authority had not made fast the door, and barred the Spirit out, he left his blessing, and taught Scrooge his precepts.<br><br>他们看到了很多，走得很远，访问了许多家庭，但总是有一个快乐的结局。精灵站在病床边，他们很愉快；在异国他乡，他们感到像在家一样；在奋斗的人身边，他们在更大的希望中耐心等待；在贫困中，它却是富饶的。在救济院、医院和监狱，在痛苦的每一个避难所，在那里渺小的人在短暂的主权下没有紧紧关闭门，把精灵拒之门外，他留下了祝福，教导斯克鲁奇他的教诲。<br><br><br><br>It was a long night, if it were only a night; but Scrooge had his doubts of this, because the Christmas Holidays appeared to be condensed into the space of time they passed together. It was strange, too, that while Scrooge remained unaltered in his outward form, the Ghost grew older, clearly older. Scrooge had observed this change, but never spoke of it, until they left a children’s Twelfth Night party, when, looking at the Spirit as they stood together in an open place, he noticed that its hair was grey.<br><br>这是一个漫长的夜晚，如果它仅仅是一个夜晚；但斯克鲁奇对此表示怀疑，因为圣诞节假期似乎被浓缩在他们共度的时光里。而且，斯克鲁奇外表没有变化，而那个鬼魂却变老了，显然是变老了。斯克鲁奇注意到了这种变化，但从未提起过，直到他们离开了一个孩子们的圣诞夜派对，当时，他们站在一个开阔的地方，他注意到那个鬼魂的头发已经花白。<br><br><br><br>“Are spirits’ lives so short?” asked Scrooge.<br><br>“精灵的生命这么短吗？”斯克鲁奇问道。<br><br><br><br>“My life upon this globe, is very brief,” replied the Ghost. “It ends to-night.”<br><br>“我在这个星球上的生命非常短暂，”鬼魂回答道。“今晚就结束了。”<br><br><br><br>“To-night!” cried Scrooge.<br><br>“今晚！”斯克鲁奇喊道。<br><br><br><br>“To-night at midnight. Hark! The time is drawing near.”<br><br>“今晚午夜时分。听！时间正在临近。”<br><br><br><br>The chimes were ringing the three quarters past eleven at that moment.<br><br>此刻，钟声正在敲响十一点三刻。<br><br><br><br>“Forgive me if I am not justified in what I ask,” said Scrooge, looking intently at the Spirit’s robe, “but I see something strange, and not belonging to yourself, protruding from your skirts. Is it a foot or a claw?”<br><br>“如果我提出的要求不合理，请原谅我，”斯克鲁奇说着，专注地看着精灵的长袍，“但我看到你的裙子下露出了一些奇怪的东西，不是你自己的东西。是一只脚还是一只爪子？”<br><br><br><br>“It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it,” was the Spirit’s sorrowful reply. “Look here.”<br><br>“可能是一只爪子，因为上面有肉，”精灵悲伤地回答，“看这里。”<br><br><br><br>From the foldings of its robe, it brought two children; wretched, abject, frightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and clung upon the outside of its garment.<br><br>从长袍的褶皱中，它拿出两个孩子；可怜、卑微、可怕、丑陋、悲惨。他们跪在它的脚下，紧紧抓住它的衣服外面。<br><br><br><br>“Oh, Man! look here. Look, look, down here!” exclaimed the Ghost.<br><br>哦，人啊！看这里。看，看，往下看！”幽灵惊叫道。<br><br><br><br>They were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish; but prostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have filled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a stale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted them, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat enthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No change, no degradation, no perversion of humanity, in any grade, through all the mysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and dread.<br><br>他们是一男一女。黄色、瘦弱、破烂、皱眉、狡猾；但也是谦卑地匍匐在地。本应被优雅的青春填满特征，并被其最鲜艳的色彩所触及的地方，却像老年人的手一样干瘪，扭曲并撕扯着他们，将他们撕成碎片。本应让天使安坐宝座的地方，却潜伏着恶魔，恶狠狠地瞪着人威胁。在所有神秘而奇妙的创造中，没有任何等级的变化、堕落或人性的扭曲，能比这些怪物更加恐怖和令人畏惧。<br><br><br><br>Ignorance and Want Scrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this way, he tried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves, rather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.<br><br>无知与渴望斯克鲁奇惊恐地后退了一步。以这种方式让他看到他们，他试图说他们是好孩子，但话到嘴边却哽咽了，不愿成为这样一个巨大谎言的共犯。<br><br><br><br>“Spirit! are they yours?” Scrooge could say no more.<br><br>“精灵！它们是你的吗？”斯克鲁奇说不出更多话来。<br><br><br><br>“They are Man’s,” said the Spirit, looking down upon them. “And they cling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want. Beware them both, and all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased. Deny it!” cried the Spirit, stretching out its hand towards the city. “Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it for your factious purposes, and make it worse. And bide the end!”<br><br>“它们是人类的，”精灵说，低头看着它们。“它们依附于我，从他们的父亲那里申诉。这个男孩是无知。这个女孩是渴望。小心他们两个，以及他们所有同类，但最重要的是小心这个男孩，因为在我的额头上，我看到的是厄运，除非这个字迹被抹去。否认它！”精灵伸出手，指向城市。“诽谤那些告诉你们的人！为了你们的目的承认它，让它变得更糟。然后等待结局！”<br><br><br><br>“Have they no refuge or resource?” cried Scrooge.<br><br>“他们没有避难所或资源吗？”斯克鲁奇喊道。<br><br><br><br>“Are there no prisons?” said the Spirit, turning on him for the last time with his own words. “Are there no workhouses?”<br><br>“难道没有监狱？”精灵说，最后一次用他自己的话对他发问。“难道没有收容所？”<br><br><br><br>The bell struck twelve.<br><br><br><br>Scrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last stroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob Marley, and lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and hooded, coming, like a mist along the ground, towards him.<br><br><br><br>STAVE FOUR. THE LAST OF THE SPIRITS. The Phantom slowly, gravely, silently, approached. When it came near him, Scrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this Spirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.<br><br>第四乐章。灵魂的最后一章。幽灵缓缓、庄重、无声地靠近。当它靠近他时，斯克鲁奇跪了下来；因为在这幽灵移动的空气中，它似乎散播着忧郁和神秘。<br><br><br><br>It was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its face, its form, and left nothing of it visible save one outstretched hand. But for this it would have been difficult to detach its figure from the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was surrounded.<br><br><br><br>He felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that its mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more, for the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.<br><br>它被一件深黑色的长袍所笼罩，遮住了它的头、脸、身形，除了伸出的一只手外，没有任何东西可见。但若不是这只手，人们很难将它的身影与黑夜区分开来，也无法将它从周围的黑暗中分离出来。 当它站在他身边时，他感觉到它高大而威严，它的神秘存在让他充满了庄严的恐惧。幽灵既没有说话也没有移动，他再也不知道其他什么了。<br><br><br><br>“I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come?” said Scrooge.<br><br>“我在圣诞未来的幽灵面前吗？”斯克鲁奇说。<br><br><br><br>The Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.<br><br>幽灵没有回答，只是用手指向前方。<br><br><br><br>“You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened, but will happen in the time before us,” Scrooge pursued. “Is that so, Spirit?”<br><br>“你即将向我展示那些尚未发生，但将在我们面前发生的事情的阴影，”斯克鲁奇追问，“是这样吗，幽灵？”<br><br><br><br>The upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its folds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only answer he received.<br><br>服装的上部在褶皱中瞬间收缩，仿佛灵魂低下了头。这就是他得到的唯一回答。<br><br><br><br>Although well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the silent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found that he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit paused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to recover.<br><br><br><br>But Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague uncertain horror, to know that behind the dusky shroud, there were ghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his own to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great heap of black.<br><br>尽管这时已经习惯了幽灵般的同伴，斯克鲁奇还是对那个无声的轮廓如此恐惧，以至于他的腿在他下面颤抖，当他准备跟随它时，他几乎站不稳。幽灵停顿了一下，观察他的状况，给他时间恢复。 但斯克鲁奇的情况变得更糟。他意识到，在昏暗的面纱后面，有一双幽灵般的眼睛专注地盯着他，而他自己尽管尽力伸长眼睛，也只能看到一只幽灵般的手和一大堆黑色东西，这让他感到一种模糊的不安和恐惧。<br><br><br><br>“Ghost of the Future!” he exclaimed, “I fear you more than any spectre I have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope to live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear you company, and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak to me?”<br><br>“未来的幽灵！”他惊呼，“我比你见过的任何幽灵都害怕你。但既然我知道你的目的是为我好，既然我希望从现在的我变成另一个人，我就准备好与你同行，并且心怀感激。你不会和我说话吗？”<br><br><br><br>It gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight before them.<br><br>它没有给他任何答复。那只手直指前方。<br><br><br><br>“Lead on!” said Scrooge. “Lead on! The night is waning fast, and it is precious time to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit!”<br><br>“带路！”斯克鲁奇说，“带路！夜色正在迅速消逝，我知道这对我是宝贵的时光。带路，精灵！”<br><br><br><br>The Phantom moved away as it had come towards him. Scrooge followed in the shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him along.<br><br>幻影如来时般退去。斯克鲁奇跟随着它的裙摆阴影，他觉得这裙子支撑着他，并带着他前行。<br><br><br><br>They scarcely seemed to enter the city; for the city rather seemed to spring up about them, and encompass them of its own act. But there they were, in the heart of it; on ’Change, amongst the merchants; who hurried up and down, and chinked the money in their pockets, and conversed in groups, and looked at their watches, and trifled thoughtfully with their great gold seals; and so forth, as Scrooge had seen them often.<br><br>他们似乎并未进入城市；因为城市似乎在他们周围自发地涌现，并将他们包围。但他们在城市的中心；在交易所，商人们来来往往，口袋里叮当作响，成群结队地交谈，看表，沉思地摆弄着他们的大金印；等等，正如斯克鲁奇经常所见。<br><br><br><br>The Spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men. Observing that the hand was pointed to them, Scrooge advanced to listen to their talk.<br><br>精灵停在了一群商人旁边。看到手指指向他们，斯克鲁奇走近去听他们的谈话。<br><br><br><br>“No,” said a great fat man with a monstrous chin, “I don’t know much about it, either way. I only know he’s dead.”<br><br>“不，”一个下巴巨大的胖子说，“我对这事儿也不太了解，不管怎样。我只知道他已经死了。”<br><br><br><br>“When did he die?” inquired another.<br><br>“他是什么时候死的？”另一个人问道。<br><br><br><br>“Last night, I believe.” “我想是昨晚。”<br><br><br><br>“Why, what was the matter with him?” asked a third, taking a vast quantity of snuff out of a very large snuff-box. “I thought he’d never die.”<br><br>“他怎么了？”第三个人问道，从一个大大的鼻烟盒里拿出一大把鼻烟。“我以为他永远不会死。”<br><br><br><br>“God knows,” said the first, with a yawn.<br><br><br><br>“What has he done with his money?” asked a red-faced gentleman with a pendulous excrescence on the end of his nose, that shook like the gills of a turkey-cock.<br><br>“天知道，”第一个人打着哈欠说。 “他把钱都用到哪里去了？”一个红脸膛的绅士问道，他的鼻尖上有一个下垂的疣，像公火鸡的翅膀一样颤动。<br><br><br><br>“I haven’t heard,” said the man with the large chin, yawning again. “Left it to his company, perhaps. He hasn’t left it to me . That’s all I know.”<br><br>“我没听说，”那个大下巴的男人说着，又打了个哈欠。“可能是留给了他的公司，也许。他没有留给我。我所知道的就是这些。”<br><br><br><br>This pleasantry was received with a general laugh.<br><br>这番话引起了大家的笑声。<br><br><br><br>“It’s likely to be a very cheap funeral,” said the same speaker; “for upon my life I don’t know of anybody to go to it. Suppose we make up a party and volunteer?”<br><br>“这个葬礼可能非常便宜，”同一个人说；“因为我敢肯定，我不知道有任何人会去参加。我们组成一个团队，自愿去怎么样？”<br><br><br><br>“I don’t mind going if a lunch is provided,” observed the gentleman with the excrescence on his nose. “But I must be fed, if I make one.”<br><br><br><br>Another laugh.<br><br><br><br>“Well, I am the most disinterested among you, after all,” said the first speaker, “for I never wear black gloves, and I never eat lunch. But I’ll offer to go, if anybody else will. When I come to think of it, I’m not at all sure that I wasn’t his most particular friend; for we used to stop and speak whenever we met. Bye, bye!”<br><br><br><br>Speakers and listeners strolled away, and mixed with other groups. Scrooge knew the men, and looked towards the Spirit for an explanation.<br><br>说话者和听众走开了，与其他人群混合在一起。斯克鲁奇认出了这些人，并向幽灵寻求解释。<br><br><br><br>The Phantom glided on into a street. Its finger pointed to two persons meeting. Scrooge listened again, thinking that the explanation might lie here.<br><br><br><br>He knew these men, also, perfectly. They were men of business: very wealthy, and of great importance. He had made a point always of standing well in their esteem: in a business point of view, that is; strictly in a business point of view.<br><br>幽灵滑进了一条街道。它的手指指向两个相遇的人。斯克鲁奇再次倾听，心想解释可能就在这里。 他也完全认识这些人。他们是商人：非常富有，且非常重要。他一直努力在他们心中保持良好的地位：从商业角度来看；严格地说，是从商业角度来看。<br><br><br><br>“How are you?” said one.<br><br>你好吗？”一个人说。<br><br><br><br>“How are you?” returned the other.<br><br>“你好吗？”另一个人回应道。<br><br><br><br>“Well!” said the first. “Old Scratch has got his own at last, hey?”<br><br>“好极了！”第一个人说。“老鬼终于有自己的了，嘿？”<br><br><br><br>“So I am told,” returned the second. “Cold, isn’t it?”<br><br>“所以我被告知，”第二个人回答，“冷，不是吗？”<br><br><br><br>“Seasonable for Christmas time. You’re not a skater, I suppose?”<br><br>“对于圣诞节来说很合适。我想你不是滑冰者吧？”<br><br><br><br>“No. No. Something else to think of. Good morning!”<br><br>“不是。不是。还有其他事情要考虑。早上好！”<br><br><br><br>Not another word. That was their meeting, their conversation, and their parting.<br><br>不再说一个字。那便是他们的会面，他们的对话，以及他们的离别。<br><br><br><br>Scrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the Spirit should attach importance to conversations apparently so trivial; but feeling assured that they must have some hidden purpose, he set himself to consider what it was likely to be. They could scarcely be supposed to have any bearing on the death of Jacob, his old partner, for that was Past, and this Ghost’s province was the Future. Nor could he think of any one immediately connected with himself, to whom he could apply them. But nothing doubting that to whomsoever they applied they had some latent moral for his own improvement, he resolved to treasure up every word he heard, and everything he saw; and especially to observe the shadow of himself when it appeared. For he had an expectation that the conduct of his future self would give him the clue he missed, and would render the solution of these riddles easy.<br><br>斯克鲁奇最初对这位精灵如此重视显然如此微不足道的对话感到惊讶；但他确信他们必有某种隐藏的目的，于是他开始思考这可能是怎样的目的。他们几乎不可能与已故的雅各布，他那位老搭档的死亡有任何关联，因为那已经是过去，而这位精灵的领域是未来。他也想不出任何与他直接相关的人，可以向他应用这些对话。但他坚信无论这些对话针对的是谁，它们都对他自己的改进有着某种潜在的意义，他决定珍藏他听到的每一个字，他所看到的每一件事；特别是当他的影子出现时，他特别注意观察。因为他期望他未来自己的行为会给他提供他错过的线索，并使这些谜题的解答变得容易。<br><br><br><br>He looked about in that very place for his own image; but another man stood in his accustomed corner, and though the clock pointed to his usual time of day for being there, he saw no likeness of himself among the multitudes that poured in through the Porch. It gave him little surprise, however; for he had been revolving in his mind a change of life, and thought and hoped he saw his new-born resolutions carried out in this.<br><br>他在那个地方四处寻找自己的影像；但另一个男人站在他习惯的角落，尽管时钟指向他通常在那里的时间，他却没在涌进门廊的人群中看到自己的影子。然而，这并没有给他带来多少惊讶；因为他一直在心里考虑改变生活，认为他看到了自己的新决心在这得到实现。<br><br><br><br>Quiet and dark, beside him stood the Phantom, with its outstretched hand. When he roused himself from his thoughtful quest, he fancied from the turn of the hand, and its situation in reference to himself, that the Unseen Eyes were looking at him keenly. It made him shudder, and feel very cold.<br><br><br><br>They left the busy scene, and went into an obscure part of the town, where Scrooge had never penetrated before, although he recognised its situation, and its bad repute. The ways were foul and narrow; the shops and houses wretched; the people half-naked, drunken, slipshod, ugly. Alleys and archways, like so many cesspools, disgorged their offences of smell, and dirt, and life, upon the straggling streets; and the whole quarter reeked with crime, with filth, and misery.<br><br>安静而阴暗，幽灵般的存在站在他旁边，伸出它的手。当他从沉思中醒来，他想象着手的转动和它相对于自己的位置，觉得无形的眼在敏锐地注视着他。这让他不寒而栗，感到非常冷。 他们离开了繁忙的场景，走进了这个城市的一个阴暗角落，尽管斯克鲁奇认出了它的位置和恶名昭彰。道路污秽狭窄；商店和房屋破败；人们半裸、醉酒、穿着破烂、丑陋。小巷和拱门，就像许多化粪池一样，将它们的臭味、污垢和生命倾泻在蜿蜒的街道上；整个区域弥漫着犯罪、污秽和苦难的气息。<br><br><br><br>Far in this den of infamous resort, there was a low-browed, beetling shop, below a pent-house roof, where iron, old rags, bottles, bones, and greasy offal, were bought. Upon the floor within, were piled up heaps of rusty keys, nails, chains, hinges, files, scales, weights, and refuse iron of all kinds. Secrets that few would like to scrutinise were bred and hidden in mountains of unseemly rags, masses of corrupted fat, and sepulchres of bones. Sitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a charcoal stove, made of old bricks, was a grey-haired rascal, nearly seventy years of age; who had screened himself from the cold air without, by a frousy curtaining of miscellaneous tatters, hung upon a line; and smoked his pipe in all the luxury of calm retirement.<br><br>在这个臭名昭著的娱乐场所深处，有一家低矮的店铺，位于一个五角屋顶下，那里买卖铁器、旧布、瓶子、骨头和油腻的下水。店内地板上堆满了生锈的钥匙、钉子、链条、铰链、锉刀、秤砣、秤砣和各式各样的废铁。一些鲜有人愿意细究的秘密，被隐藏在堆积如山的破烂布料、腐败的脂肪和骨头坟墓中。在一堆他经营的货物中，一个满头灰发的恶棍坐在一个由旧砖砌成的炭火炉旁，几乎七十岁；他用一条杂乱无章的破布窗帘遮住了外面的冷风，悠闲地抽着烟斗。<br><br><br><br>Scrooge and the Phantom came into the presence of this man, just as a woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop. But she had scarcely entered, when another woman, similarly laden, came in too; and she was closely followed by a man in faded black, who was no less startled by the sight of them, than they had been upon the recognition of each other. After a short period of blank astonishment, in which the old man with the pipe had joined them, they all three burst into a laugh.<br><br>Scrooge 和幽灵来到这个人面前，就在一个背着沉重包裹的女人溜进商店的时候。但她刚一进门，另一个同样背着包裹的女人也进来了；紧接着，一个穿着褪色黑衣的男人也跟了进来，他对她们的到来感到惊讶，不亚于她们在彼此认出对方时的惊讶。在短暂的茫然惊讶之后，那个拿着烟斗的老人也加入了他们，他们三个人突然大笑起来。<br><br><br><br>“Let the charwoman alone to be the first!” cried she who had entered first. “Let the laundress alone to be the second; and let the undertaker’s man alone to be the third. Look here, old Joe, here’s a chance! If we haven’t all three met here without meaning it!”<br><br>“让那个女清洁工先来！”第一个进来的女人喊道。“让那个洗衣女工来第二个；让那个殡仪馆的人来第三个。看这里，老乔，这里是个机会！如果我们三个不是无意中在这里相遇的话！”<br><br><br><br>“You couldn’t have met in a better place,” said old Joe, removing his pipe from his mouth. “Come into the parlour. You were made free of it long ago, you know; and the other two an’t strangers. Stop till I shut the door of the shop. Ah! How it skreeks! There an’t such a rusty bit of metal in the place as its own hinges, I believe; and I’m sure there’s no such old bones here, as mine. Ha, ha! We’re all suitable to our calling, we’re well matched. Come into the parlour. Come into the parlour.”<br><br>“你不可能在一个更好的地方相遇，”老乔说着，从嘴里拿下了烟斗。“进来客厅。你知道，你很久以前就被释放了；另外两个人也不是陌生人。等我关上商店的门。哎呀！它发出多么刺耳的声音！我相信这个地方没有哪一块生锈的金属比得上它自己的铰链，而且我敢肯定这里没有像我这样老骨头的人。哈哈！我们都适合我们的职业，我们很般配。进来客厅。进来客厅。”<br><br><br><br>The parlour was the space behind the screen of rags. The old man raked the fire together with an old stair-rod, and having trimmed his smoky lamp (for it was night), with the stem of his pipe, put it in his mouth again.<br><br><br><br>While he did this, the woman who had already spoken threw her bundle on the floor, and sat down in a flaunting manner on a stool; crossing her elbows on her knees, and looking with a bold defiance at the other two.<br><br>客厅是布帘后面的空间。老人用一根旧楼梯杆拨弄着火，用烟斗的杆子修剪了他的烟雾灯（因为现在是晚上），然后再次把它放回嘴里。 当他这样做的时候，那个已经说话的女人把她的包裹扔到地上，以一种傲慢的姿态坐在一个凳子上；交叉双肘放在膝盖上，大胆地挑衅地看着另外两个人。<br><br><br><br>“What odds then! What odds, Mrs. Dilber?” said the woman. “Every person has a right to take care of themselves. He always did.”<br><br>“那又怎样！几率又怎样，迪尔伯太太？”女人说。“每个人都有照顾自己的权利。他一直都是这样。”<br><br><br><br>“That’s true, indeed!” said the laundress. “No man more so.”<br><br>“这确实是！”洗衣妇说。“没有人比他更如此。”<br><br><br><br>“Why then, don’t stand staring as if you was afraid, woman; who’s the wiser? We’re not going to pick holes in each other’s coats, I suppose?”<br><br>“那为什么，女人，别像害怕似的站着直瞪，谁更聪明？我想我们不会互相挑剔衣服上的破洞吧？”<br><br><br><br>“No, indeed!” said Mrs. Dilber and the man together. “We should hope not.”<br><br>“不，确实！”迪尔伯太太和那个男人一起说。“我们希望不是这样。”<br><br><br><br>“Very well, then!” cried the woman. “That’s enough. Who’s the worse for the loss of a few things like these? Not a dead man, I suppose.”<br><br>“那好吧！”女人喊道。“这就足够了。失去这些东西谁更糟糕？我想不是死人吧。”<br><br><br><br>“No, indeed,” said Mrs. Dilber, laughing.<br><br>“不，确实，”迪尔伯太太笑着说。<br><br><br><br>“If he wanted to keep ’em after he was dead, a wicked old screw,” pursued the woman, “why wasn’t he natural in his lifetime? If he had been, he’d have had somebody to look after him when he was struck with Death, instead of lying gasping out his last there, alone by himself.”<br><br>如果他死后还想保留他们，一个邪恶的老混蛋，”女人继续说，“那他为什么在他生前不自然一点？如果他那样做了，当他被死神击中时，就会有别人照顾他，而不是独自在那里喘着气，孤独地死去。”<br><br><br><br>“It’s the truest word that ever was spoke,” said Mrs. Dilber. “It’s a judgment on him.”<br><br>“这是最真实的话，”迪尔伯太太说，“这是对他的评判。”<br><br><br><br>“I wish it was a little heavier judgment,” replied the woman; “and it should have been, you may depend upon it, if I could have laid my hands on anything else. Open that bundle, old Joe, and let me know the value of it. Speak out plain. I’m not afraid to be the first, nor afraid for them to see it. We know pretty well that we were helping ourselves, before we met here, I believe. It’s no sin. Open the bundle, Joe.”<br><br>“我希望这个评判更严厉一些，”女人回答说；“而且我可以向你保证，如果我能找到其他东西的话，它应该会更严厉。老乔，打开那个包裹，告诉我它的价值。直言不讳。我不怕第一个说出来，也不怕他们看到。我相信在我们来这里之前，我们已经很清楚我们在帮助自己，这不是罪。乔，打开包裹。”<br><br><br><br>But the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this; and the man in faded black, mounting the breach first, produced his plunder. It was not extensive. A seal or two, a pencil-case, a pair of sleeve-buttons, and a brooch of no great value, were all. They were severally examined and appraised by old Joe, who chalked the sums he was disposed to give for each, upon the wall, and added them up into a total when he found there was nothing more to come.<br><br>但是，她朋友们的英勇行为不允许这样；那个穿着褪色黑衣的男人首先爬上缺口，拿出了他的战利品。这些战利品并不多。一两枚图章，一个铅笔盒，一对袖扣，以及一枚价值不高的胸针，就是全部。老乔逐一检查并评估了这些物品，他在墙上写下他愿意为每件物品给出的金额，并在发现没有更多东西时将它们加起来。<br><br><br><br>“That’s your account,” said Joe, “and I wouldn’t give another sixpence, if I was to be boiled for not doing it. Who’s next?”<br><br><br><br>Mrs. Dilber was next. Sheets and towels, a little wearing apparel, two old-fashioned silver teaspoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and a few boots. Her account was stated on the wall in the same manner.<br><br>“这就是你的账目，”乔说，“即使我被煮了，我也不会多给六便士。下一位是谁？” 接下来是迪尔伯太太。床单和毛巾，一些衣物，两把老式的银汤匙，一把糖夹，还有几双靴子。她的账目也以同样的方式写在墙上。<br><br><br><br>“I always give too much to ladies. It’s a weakness of mine, and that’s the way I ruin myself,” said old Joe. “That’s your account. If you asked me for another penny, and made it an open question, I’d repent of being so liberal and knock off half-a-crown.”<br><br><br><br>“And now undo my bundle, Joe,” said the first woman.<br><br><br><br>Joe went down on his knees for the greater convenience of opening it, and having unfastened a great many knots, dragged out a large and heavy roll of some dark stuff.<br><br><br><br>“What do you call this?” said Joe. “Bed-curtains!”<br><br>“你叫什么？”乔说。“床帘！”<br><br><br><br>“Ah!” returned the woman, laughing and leaning forward on her crossed arms. “Bed-curtains!”<br><br>“啊！”女人笑着，双手交叉向前倾。“床帘！”<br><br><br><br>“You don’t mean to say you took ’em down, rings and all, with him lying there?” said Joe.<br><br>“你不是说，他躺在那里，你把床帘连同环一起都拿下来了？”乔说。<br><br><br><br>“Yes I do,” replied the woman. “Why not?”<br><br>“是的，我确实，”女人回答，“为什么不呢？”<br><br><br><br>“You were born to make your fortune,” said Joe, “and you’ll certainly do it.”<br><br>“你生来就是为了创造财富，”乔说，“你肯定能成功。”<br><br><br><br>“I certainly shan’t hold my hand, when I can get anything in it by reaching it out, for the sake of such a man as He was, I promise you, Joe,” returned the woman coolly. “Don’t drop that oil upon the blankets, now.”<br><br>“我当然不会袖手旁观，当我伸手就能得到任何东西的时候，为了像他这样的人，我向你保证，乔，”女人冷静地回答。“现在别把油倒在毯子上。”<br><br><br><br>“His blankets?” asked Joe.<br><br>他的毯子？”乔问道。<br><br><br><br>“Whose else’s do you think?” replied the woman. “He isn’t likely to take cold without ’em, I dare say.”<br><br>“你认为是谁的？”女人回答，“没有它们，他不可能轻易感冒，我敢打赌。”<br><br><br><br>“I hope he didn’t die of anything catching? Eh?” said old Joe, stopping in his work, and looking up.<br><br>“我希望他没有因为什么传染病而死？嗯？”老乔停下手中的工作，抬头说。<br><br><br><br>“Don’t you be afraid of that,” returned the woman. “I an’t so fond of his company that I’d loiter about him for such things, if he did. Ah! you may look through that shirt till your eyes ache; but you won’t find a hole in it, nor a threadbare place. It’s the best he had, and a fine one too. They’d have wasted it, if it hadn’t been for me.”<br><br>“别怕那个，”女人回答道，“我不那么喜欢和他在一起，为了这种事情在他身边闲逛。哎呀！你可以把那件衬衫翻来覆去地看，直到眼睛酸痛；但你不会在它上面找到洞，也不会找到破的地方。这是他最好的，也是一件漂亮的衣服。如果不是因为我，他们早就浪费了它。”<br><br><br><br>“What do you call wasting of it?” asked old Joe.<br><br><br><br>“Putting it on him to be buried in, to be sure,” replied the woman with a laugh. “Somebody was fool enough to do it, but I took it off again. If calico an’t good enough for such a purpose, it isn’t good enough for anything. It’s quite as becoming to the body. He can’t look uglier than he did in that one.”<br><br>“你说的浪费是指什么？”老乔问道。 “当然是把它穿在身上埋葬了，”女人笑着回答。“有人傻到这么做，但我又把它脱了下来。如果粗布不适合这样的用途，那么它也不适合任何东西。它对身体的适应性很好。他穿那件衣服看起来不会比现在更丑了。”<br><br><br><br>Scrooge listened to this dialogue in horror. As they sat grouped about their spoil, in the scanty light afforded by the old man’s lamp, he viewed them with a detestation and disgust, which could hardly have been greater, though they had been obscene demons, marketing the corpse itself.<br><br>Scrooge 听着这段对话，心中充满了恐惧。当他们围坐在他们的战利品周围，在老人那昏暗的灯光下，他带着厌恶和憎恨看着他们，这种情绪几乎无法再强烈，即使他们真的是下流恶魔，在买卖尸体本身。<br><br><br><br>“Ha, ha!” laughed the same woman, when old Joe, producing a flannel bag with money in it, told out their several gains upon the ground. “This is the end of it, you see! He frightened every one away from him when he was alive, to profit us when he was dead! Ha, ha, ha!”<br><br><br><br>“Spirit!” said Scrooge, shuddering from head to foot. “I see, I see. The case of this unhappy man might be my own. My life tends that way, now. Merciful Heaven, what is this!”<br><br>“哈哈，哈哈！”当老乔拿出一个装着钱的法兰绒袋子，在地上数出他们各自的收益时，那个女人大笑。“你看，这就是结局！他活着的时候把每个人都吓跑了，现在他死了，却要让我们获利！哈哈，哈哈，哈哈！” “精灵！”Scrooge 颤抖着说，“我明白了，我明白了。这个不幸人的情况可能就是我的。我的生活正走向那个方向，现在。慈悲的上帝，这是怎么回事！”<br><br><br><br>He recoiled in terror, for the scene had changed, and now he almost touched a bed: a bare, uncurtained bed: on which, beneath a ragged sheet, there lay a something covered up, which, though it was dumb, announced itself in awful language.<br><br>他惊恐地退缩，因为场景已经改变，现在他几乎触碰到一张床：一张裸露无帘的床：床上，在一块破旧的毯子下，覆盖着某物，尽管它沉默无声，却用可怕的语言宣告了自己的存在。<br><br><br><br>The room was very dark, too dark to be observed with any accuracy, though Scrooge glanced round it in obedience to a secret impulse, anxious to know what kind of room it was. A pale light, rising in the outer air, fell straight upon the bed; and on it, plundered and bereft, unwatched, unwept, uncared for, was the body of this man.<br><br><br><br>Scrooge glanced towards the Phantom. Its steady hand was pointed to the head. The cover was so carelessly adjusted that the slightest raising of it, the motion of a finger upon Scrooge’s part, would have disclosed the face. He thought of it, felt how easy it would be to do, and longed to do it; but had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss the spectre at his side.<br><br>房间非常黑暗，太黑了以至于无法准确观察，尽管斯克鲁奇出于一种秘密的冲动环顾四周，渴望知道这是什么房间。一束苍白的光线从外面升起，直射到床上；而床上，这个男人被掠夺、被剥夺、无人看守、无人哭泣、无人照料，他的尸体就躺在那里。 斯克鲁奇朝向幽灵。它稳定的手指向头部。覆盖物被随意地调整，稍微抬起一点，斯克鲁奇手指的轻微动作，就会揭露他的脸。他想过这一点，感觉到这样做很容易，渴望这么做；但他没有力量撤去面纱，就像他没有力量驱散他身边的幽灵一样。<br><br><br><br>Oh cold, cold, rigid, dreadful Death, set up thine altar here, and dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy command: for this is thy dominion! But of the loved, revered, and honoured head, thou canst not turn one hair to thy dread purposes, or make one feature odious. It is not that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released; it is not that the heart and pulse are still; but that the hand was open, generous, and true; the heart brave, warm, and tender; and the pulse a man’s. Strike, Shadow, strike! And see his good deeds springing from the wound, to sow the world with life immortal!<br><br>哦，寒冷、寒冷、僵硬、可怕的死亡，在这里设立你的祭坛，用你所能支配的恐怖来装饰它：因为这是你的领地！但你无法将那被爱、被尊敬和被崇敬的头颅转向你的恐怖目的，也无法使任何面部特征变得可憎。不是手沉重，释放时会落下；不是心率和脉搏停止；而是手曾经是开放的、慷慨的、真诚的；心勇敢、热情、温柔；脉搏是男人的。打击，阴影，打击！看看他的善行从伤口中迸发出来，播撒永恒的生命之种！<br><br><br><br>No voice pronounced these words in Scrooge’s ears, and yet he heard them when he looked upon the bed. He thought, if this man could be raised up now, what would be his foremost thoughts? Avarice, hard-dealing, griping cares? They have brought him to a rich end, truly!<br><br>斯克鲁奇没有听到任何声音在他耳边说出这些话，但当他看到床时，他却听到了。他想，如果这个人现在能被唤醒，他的首要想法会是什么？贪婪、苛刻的交易、紧握的忧虑？它们确实带给他一个富有的结局！<br><br><br><br>He lay, in the dark empty house, with not a man, a woman, or a child, to say that he was kind to me in this or that, and for the memory of one kind word I will be kind to him. A cat was tearing at the door, and there was a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearth-stone. What they wanted in the room of death, and why they were so restless and disturbed, Scrooge did not dare to think.<br><br>他躺在黑暗空旷的房子里，没有一个人、一个女人或一个孩子可以说他在这个或那个方面对我好，为了记住一句善意的话，我会对他好。一只猫在撕咬着门，炉石下面传来老鼠啃食的声音。他们在死者的房间里想要什么，为什么他们如此不安和烦躁，斯克鲁奇不敢去想。<br><br><br><br>“Spirit!” he said, “this is a fearful place. In leaving it, I shall not leave its lesson, trust me. Let us go!”<br><br>“精灵！”他说，“这是一个可怕的地方。离开它时，我不会忘记它的教训，相信我。让我们走吧！”<br><br><br><br>Still the Ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the head.<br><br>然而，鬼魂还是用不动声色的手指指向了头部。<br><br><br><br>“I understand you,” Scrooge returned, “and I would do it, if I could. But I have not the power, Spirit. I have not the power.”<br><br>我明白你的意思，”斯克鲁奇回答道，“如果我能的话，我会这么做。但我没有力量，精灵。我没有力量。”<br><br><br><br>Again it seemed to look upon him.<br><br>似乎精灵又看了看他。<br><br><br><br>“If there is any person in the town, who feels emotion caused by this man’s death,” said Scrooge quite agonised, “show that person to me, Spirit, I beseech you!”<br><br>“如果镇上有人因为这个人的死而感到情感，”斯克鲁奇痛苦地说，“精灵，求你了，带那个人给我看看！”<br><br><br><br>The Phantom spread its dark robe before him for a moment, like a wing; and withdrawing it, revealed a room by daylight, where a mother and her children were.<br><br>幻影在他面前展开了一会它的黑色长袍，像翅膀一样；然后收起它，揭示了一个在日光下的房间，那里有一个母亲和她的孩子们。<br><br><br><br>She was expecting some one, and with anxious eagerness; for she walked up and down the room; started at every sound; looked out from the window; glanced at the clock; tried, but in vain, to work with her needle; and could hardly bear the voices of the children in their play.<br><br><br><br>At length the long-expected knock was heard. She hurried to the door, and met her husband; a man whose face was careworn and depressed, though he was young. There was a remarkable expression in it now; a kind of serious delight of which he felt ashamed, and which he struggled to repress.<br><br>她正期待着某人，带着焦急的渴望；因为她来回踱步；对每一个声音都感到惊吓；从窗户向外看；瞥了一眼时钟；试图用她的针线工作，但徒劳无功；几乎无法忍受孩子们玩耍时的声音。 终于，期待已久的敲门声被听到了。她急忙跑到门口，遇到了她的丈夫；一个虽然年轻但面容憔悴、沮丧的男人。他的脸上现在有一种非凡的表情；一种他感到羞愧的严肃喜悦，他努力抑制着。<br><br><br><br>He sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for him by the fire; and when she asked him faintly what news (which was not until after a long silence), he appeared embarrassed how to answer.<br><br>他坐在火炉边为他准备的晚餐前；当她轻声问他有什么消息（这还是在长时间的沉默之后）时，他显得有些尴尬，不知道如何回答。<br><br><br><br>“Is it good?” she said, “or bad?”—to help him.<br><br>“是好事吗？”她说，“还是坏事？”——以帮助他。<br><br><br><br>“Bad,” he answered. “坏事，”他回答。<br><br><br><br>“We are quite ruined?” 我们完全完蛋了吗？<br><br><br><br>“No. There is hope yet, Caroline.”<br><br>不。还有希望，卡罗琳。<br><br><br><br>“If he relents,” she said, amazed, “there is! Nothing is past hope, if such a miracle has happened.”<br><br>如果他心软了，”她惊讶地说，“那就有了！如果发生了这样的奇迹，就没有什么是过不去的。”<br><br><br><br>“He is past relenting,” said her husband. “He is dead.”<br><br>他已无回旋余地，”她丈夫说。“他已经死了。”<br><br><br><br>She was a mild and patient creature if her face spoke truth; but she was thankful in her soul to hear it, and she said so, with clasped hands. She prayed forgiveness the next moment, and was sorry; but the first was the emotion of her heart.<br><br>如果她的脸能说话，她是一个温和而耐心的人；但她在灵魂深处为此感到庆幸，她双手合十地说出了这一点。下一刻，她祈求原谅，感到抱歉；但前者是她内心的情感。<br><br><br><br>“What the half-drunken woman whom I told you of last night, said to me, when I tried to see him and obtain a week’s delay; and what I thought was a mere excuse to avoid me; turns out to have been quite true. He was not only very ill, but dying, then.”<br><br>“昨晚我告诉你的那个半醉的女人，当我试图去看他并争取一周的延期时，对我说的话；还有我认为只是想避开我的借口；结果证明是完全真实的。他不仅病得很重，而且当时正在临终。”<br><br><br><br>“To whom will our debt be transferred?”<br><br>“我们的债务将转给谁？”<br><br><br><br>“I don’t know. But before that time we shall be ready with the money; and even though we were not, it would be a bad fortune indeed to find so merciless a creditor in his successor. We may sleep to-night with light hearts, Caroline!”<br><br>“我不知道。但在那时之前，我们将会准备好钱；即使我们没有准备好，发现一个如此无情的债权人在他的继任者中确实是不幸的。我们可以今晚安心入睡，卡罗琳！”<br><br><br><br>Yes. Soften it as they would, their hearts were lighter. The children’s faces, hushed and clustered round to hear what they so little understood, were brighter; and it was a happier house for this man’s death! The only emotion that the Ghost could show him, caused by the event, was one of pleasure.<br><br>是的。尽管他们会尽量缓和，但他们的心情还是轻松了。孩子们的脸庞，安静地聚集在一起，听着他们几乎不理解的事情，更加明亮了；这个人的死让这个家更加幸福！幽灵因这一事件而表现出的唯一情感是愉悦。<br><br><br><br>“Let me see some tenderness connected with a death,” said Scrooge; “or that dark chamber, Spirit, which we left just now, will be for ever present to me.”<br><br>让我看看一些与死亡有关的柔情，”斯克鲁奇说；“或者，精灵，我们刚才离开的那个黑暗的房间，将永远留存在我心中。”<br><br><br><br>The Ghost conducted him through several streets familiar to his feet; and as they went along, Scrooge looked here and there to find himself, but nowhere was he to be seen. They entered poor Bob Cratchit’s house; the dwelling he had visited before; and found the mother and the children seated round the fire.<br><br><br><br>Quiet. Very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits were as still as statues in one corner, and sat looking up at Peter, who had a book before him. The mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing. But surely they were very quiet!<br><br>鬼魂带着他穿过几条他熟悉的街道；他们沿着路走，斯克鲁奇四处张望，试图找到自己，但哪里都看不到他。他们进入了可怜的鲍勃·克雷奇特的房子；他之前曾拜访过的住所；发现母亲和孩子们围坐在火炉旁。 安静。非常安静。喧闹的小克雷奇特们像雕像一样在一角静静地坐着，抬头看着面前有书的彼得。母亲和她的女儿们正在缝纫。但她们确实非常安静！<br><br><br><br>“‘And He took a child, and set him in the midst of them.’”<br><br>“他拿起一个孩子，把他放在他们中间。”<br><br><br><br>Where had Scrooge heard those words? He had not dreamed them. The boy must have read them out, as he and the Spirit crossed the threshold. Why did he not go on?<br><br>斯克鲁奇在哪里听到这些话的？他并没有做梦。那个男孩一定是在他和精灵穿过门槛时读出来的。他为什么不继续读下去呢？<br><br><br><br>The mother laid her work upon the table, and put her hand up to her face.<br><br>母亲把她的工作放在桌子上，把手放在脸上。<br><br><br><br>“The colour hurts my eyes,” she said.<br><br>“这颜色刺痛了我的眼睛，”她说。<br><br><br><br>The colour? Ah, poor Tiny Tim!<br><br>颜色？哎呀，可怜的小蒂姆！<br><br><br><br>“They’re better now again,” said Cratchit’s wife. “It makes them weak by candle-light; and I wouldn’t show weak eyes to your father when he comes home, for the world. It must be near his time.”<br><br>“现在又好了，”克拉斯契特太太说。“蜡烛光会让他们感到虚弱；他回家的时候，我可不想让他看到我眼睛虚弱的样子，无论如何。肯定快到时间了。”<br><br><br><br>“Past it rather,” Peter answered, shutting up his book. “But I think he has walked a little slower than he used, these few last evenings, mother.”<br><br>“已经过去了，”彼得回答，合上了他的书。“但我认为他最近这几个晚上走路比以前慢了一些，妈妈。”<br><br><br><br>They were very quiet again. At last she said, and in a steady, cheerful voice, that only faltered once:<br><br>他们又安静了下来。最后她用平稳而愉快的语气说，只犹豫了一次：<br><br><br><br>“I have known him walk with—I have known him walk with Tiny Tim upon his shoulder, very fast indeed.”<br><br>“我知道他曾经背着 Tiny Tim 走路——我知道他曾经背着 Tiny Tim 走路，确实很快。”<br><br><br><br>“And so have I,” cried Peter. “Often.”<br><br><br><br>“And so have I,” exclaimed another. So had all.<br><br><br><br>“But he was very light to carry,” she resumed, intent upon her work, “and his father loved him so, that it was no trouble: no trouble. And there is your father at the door!”<br><br><br><br>She hurried out to meet him; and little Bob in his comforter—he had need of it, poor fellow—came in. His tea was ready for him on the hob, and they all tried who should help him to it most. Then the two young Cratchits got upon his knees and laid, each child a little cheek, against his face, as if they said, “Don’t mind it, father. Don’t be grieved!”<br><br>她急忙出去迎接他；而穿着睡衣的小鲍勃——可怜的家伙，他需要它——走了进来。他的茶已经在炉子上准备好了，大家都争着帮他拿。然后两个年轻克雷奇特跪在地上，每个孩子把小脸贴在他的脸上，好像在说：“别在意，爸爸。别难过！”<br><br><br><br>Bob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to all the family. He looked at the work upon the table, and praised the industry and speed of Mrs. Cratchit and the girls. They would be done long before Sunday, he said.<br><br>鲍勃和他们在一起非常开心，和全家人都愉快地交谈。他看着桌子上的工作，赞扬了克雷奇特夫人和女孩们的勤奋和速度。他说，他们会在星期日之前完成。<br><br><br><br>“Sunday! You went to-day, then, Robert?” said his wife.<br><br>“星期日！那么你是今天去的，罗伯特？”他的妻子说。<br><br><br><br>“Yes, my dear,” returned Bob. “I wish you could have gone. It would have done you good to see how green a place it is. But you’ll see it often. I promised him that I would walk there on a Sunday. My little, little child!” cried Bob. “My little child!”<br><br><br><br>He broke down all at once. He couldn’t help it. If he could have helped it, he and his child would have been farther apart perhaps than they were.<br><br><br><br>He left the room, and went up-stairs into the room above, which was lighted cheerfully, and hung with Christmas. There was a chair set close beside the child, and there were signs of some one having been there, lately. Poor Bob sat down in it, and when he had thought a little and composed himself, he kissed the little face. He was reconciled to what had happened, and went down again quite happy.<br><br><br><br>They drew about the fire, and talked; the girls and mother working still. Bob told them of the extraordinary kindness of Mr. Scrooge’s nephew, whom he had scarcely seen but once, and who, meeting him in the street that day, and seeing that he looked a little—“just a little down you know,” said Bob, inquired what had happened to distress him. “On which,” said Bob, “for he is the pleasantest-spoken gentleman you ever heard, I told him. ‘I am heartily sorry for it, Mr. Cratchit,’ he said, ‘and heartily sorry for your good wife.’ By the bye, how he ever knew that , I don’t know.”<br><br>他们围在火炉旁，交谈着；女孩和母亲还在忙碌。鲍勃告诉他们斯克鲁奇侄子的非凡善良，他只见过他一次，那天在街上遇到他，看到他看起来有点——‘你知道，只是有点沮丧，’鲍勃说，便问他发生了什么事让他烦恼。“于是，”鲍勃说，“因为他是你听说过的最会说话的绅士，我就这么跟他说了。‘我非常抱歉，克拉奇特先生，’他说，‘我也非常抱歉你那好妻子。’顺便问一下，他是怎么知道这些的，我不知道。”<br><br><br><br>“Knew what, my dear?” “知道什么，亲爱的？”<br><br><br><br>“Why, that you were a good wife,” replied Bob.<br><br>“哦，就是你是个好妻子，”鲍勃回答。<br><br><br><br>“Everybody knows that!” said Peter.<br><br>“每个人都知道！”彼得说。<br><br><br><br>“Very well observed, my boy!” cried Bob. “I hope they do. ‘Heartily sorry,’ he said, ‘for your good wife. If I can be of service to you in any way,’ he said, giving me his card, ‘that’s where I live. Pray come to me.’ Now, it wasn’t,” cried Bob, “for the sake of anything he might be able to do for us, so much as for his kind way, that this was quite delightful. It really seemed as if he had known our Tiny Tim, and felt with us.”<br><br>“观察得很好，我的孩子！”鲍勃大声说。“我希望他们确实如此。‘衷心道歉，’他说，‘为你的好妻子。如果我在任何方面能为你效劳，’他说，递给我他的名片，“这就是我的住址。请来找我。’现在，这并不是，”鲍勃大声说，“因为他可能为我们做任何事情，更多的是因为他善良的方式，这真是太令人高兴了。他真的好像认识我们的蒂姆，和我们感同身受。”<br><br><br><br>“I’m sure he’s a good soul!” said Mrs. Cratchit.<br><br>“我相信他是个好人！”克雷奇特太太说。<br><br><br><br>“You would be surer of it, my dear,” returned Bob, “if you saw and spoke to him. I shouldn’t be at all surprised—mark what I say!—if he got Peter a better situation.”<br><br>“亲爱的，你要是见到他并和他说话，就会更有把握了，”鲍勃回答道，“如果他给彼得找个更好的工作，我一点也不感到惊讶——注意我说的话！……”<br><br><br><br>“Only hear that, Peter,” said Mrs. Cratchit.<br><br>“彼得，你只听这个，”克拉斯契特夫人说。<br><br><br><br>“And then,” cried one of the girls, “Peter will be keeping company with some one, and setting up for himself.”<br><br>“然后，”一个女孩喊道，“彼得就要和某人交往，自立门户了。”<br><br><br><br>“Get along with you!” retorted Peter, grinning.<br><br>“你这家伙！”彼得笑着反驳道。<br><br><br><br>“It’s just as likely as not,” said Bob, “one of these days; though there’s plenty of time for that, my dear. But however and whenever we part from one another, I am sure we shall none of us forget poor Tiny Tim—shall we—or this first parting that there was among us?”<br><br>“也许吧，”鲍勃说，“总有一天；不过时间还很多，亲爱的。但无论何时何地我们分开，我相信我们都不会忘记可怜的小蒂姆——对吧——或者我们之间的这次离别？”<br><br><br><br>“Never, father!” cried they all.<br><br>“永远不会，爸爸！”他们都喊道。<br><br><br><br>“And I know,” said Bob, “I know, my dears, that when we recollect how patient and how mild he was; although he was a little, little child; we shall not quarrel easily among ourselves, and forget poor Tiny Tim in doing it.”<br><br>“我知道，”鲍勃说，“我知道，亲爱的们，当我们回想他有多么耐心、多么温和；尽管他只是个小孩；我们就不容易争吵，也不会在争吵中忘记可怜的小蒂姆。”<br><br><br><br>“No, never, father!” they all cried again.<br><br>“不，决不会，爸爸！”他们都再次喊道。<br><br><br><br>“I am very happy,” said little Bob, “I am very happy!”<br><br>“我很高兴，”小鲍勃说，“我很高兴！”<br><br><br><br>Mrs. Cratchit kissed him, his daughters kissed him, the two young Cratchits kissed him, and Peter and himself shook hands. Spirit of Tiny Tim, thy childish essence was from God!<br><br>克拉奇特太太吻了他，她的女儿们吻了他，两个年轻克拉奇特也吻了他，皮特和他自己握手。小蒂姆的灵魂啊，你那童真的本质来自上帝！<br><br><br><br>“Spectre,” said Scrooge, “something informs me that our parting moment is at hand. I know it, but I know not how. Tell me what man that was whom we saw lying dead?”<br><br><br><br>The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come conveyed him, as before—though at a different time, he thought: indeed, there seemed no order in these latter visions, save that they were in the Future—into the resorts of business men, but showed him not himself. Indeed, the Spirit did not stay for anything, but went straight on, as to the end just now desired, until besought by Scrooge to tarry for a moment.<br><br>“幽灵，”斯克鲁奇说，“有什么东西告诉我，我们分别的时刻即将到来。我知道，但不知道为什么。告诉我我们看到的那个躺在地上的人是谁？” 圣诞未来的幽灵再次带他去了——尽管他认为是在不同的时间，实际上，这些后来的幻象似乎没有秩序，除了它们都在未来——带到了商人们的娱乐场所，但并没有展示他自己。实际上，幽灵并没有停留，而是径直向前，就像刚才所期望的那样，直到斯克鲁奇请求他稍作停留。<br><br><br><br>“This court,” said Scrooge, “through which we hurry now, is where my place of occupation is, and has been for a length of time. I see the house. Let me behold what I shall be, in days to come!”<br><br>“这个法庭，”斯克鲁奇说，“我们正匆忙穿过的地方，就是我的工作场所，已经有一段时间了。我看到那座房子了。让我看看我将来会变成什么样子！”<br><br><br><br>The Spirit stopped; the hand was pointed elsewhere.<br><br>精灵停了下来，手指指向别处。<br><br><br><br>“The house is yonder,” Scrooge exclaimed. “Why do you point away?”<br><br>“那座房子在那儿，”斯克鲁奇惊呼。“你为什么指那边？”<br><br><br><br>The inexorable finger underwent no change.<br><br>不可阻挡的手指没有变化。<br><br><br><br>Scrooge hastened to the window of his office, and looked in. It was an office still, but not his. The furniture was not the same, and the figure in the chair was not himself. The Phantom pointed as before.<br><br>斯克鲁奇急忙跑到他的办公室窗户前，朝里看去。办公室还是那个办公室，但不是他的。家具不一样了，椅子上的人也不是他自己。幽灵像之前一样指着。<br><br><br><br>He joined it once again, and wondering why and whither he had gone, accompanied it until they reached an iron gate. He paused to look round before entering.<br><br>他再次加入了它，疑惑自己为什么以及去了哪里，一直跟着它，直到他们到达一个铁门。他停下来环顾四周，然后才进去。<br><br><br><br>A churchyard. Here, then; the wretched man whose name he had now to learn, lay underneath the ground. It was a worthy place. Walled in by houses; overrun by grass and weeds, the growth of vegetation’s death, not life; choked up with too much burying; fat with repleted appetite. A worthy place!<br><br>教堂墓地。这里，就是那个他现在必须学习的名字的可怜人躺在地下。这是一个值得的地方。被房屋包围；被草和野草覆盖，这是植被死亡的产物，而非生命；因过度埋葬而堵塞；因满足的食欲而肥胖。一个值得的地方！<br><br><br><br>The Spirit stood among the graves, and pointed down to One. He advanced towards it trembling. The Phantom was exactly as it had been, but he dreaded that he saw new meaning in its solemn shape.<br><br><br><br>“Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point,” said Scrooge, “answer me one question. Are these the shadows of the things that Will be, or are they shadows of things that May be, only?”<br><br>幽灵站在坟墓之间，指向一个地方。他颤抖着朝它走去。这个幽灵和以前一模一样，但他害怕自己在这庄严肃穆的形状中看到了新的含义。 “在我走近你指的那块石头之前，”斯克鲁奇说，“回答我一个问题。这些是即将发生的事情的影子，还是仅仅可能是的事情的影子？”<br><br><br><br>Still the Ghost pointed downward to the grave by which it stood.<br><br><br><br>“Men’s courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if persevered in, they must lead,” said Scrooge. “But if the courses be departed from, the ends will change. Say it is thus with what you show me!”<br><br><br><br>The Spirit was immovable as ever.<br><br><br><br>Scrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went; and following the finger, read upon the stone of the neglected grave his own name, Ebenezer Scrooge.<br><br>Scrooge 蹑手蹑脚地走向它，一路上颤抖不已；他顺着手指，在荒废的墓碑上读到了自己的名字，艾比尼泽·斯克鲁奇。<br><br><br><br>The Last of the Spirits “Am I that man who lay upon the bed?” he cried, upon his knees.<br><br>最后一位精灵“我躺在这床上的人是我吗？”他跪在地上喊道。<br><br><br><br>The finger pointed from the grave to him, and back again.<br><br>手指从坟墓指向他，又指回坟墓。<br><br><br><br>“No, Spirit! Oh no, no!”<br><br>不，精灵！哦不，不！<br><br><br><br>The finger still was there.<br><br>手指仍然在那里。<br><br><br><br>“Spirit!” he cried, tight clutching at its robe, “hear me! I am not the man I was. I will not be the man I must have been but for this intercourse. Why show me this, if I am past all hope!”<br><br>“精灵！”他喊道，紧紧抓住他的长袍，“听我说！我已不再是过去的我。如果不是因为这次交流，我也不会成为必须成为的我。为什么向我展示这个，如果我已经没有希望了！”<br><br><br><br>For the first time the hand appeared to shake.<br><br>第一次，他的手似乎在颤抖。<br><br><br><br>“Good Spirit,” he pursued, as down upon the ground he fell before it: “Your nature intercedes for me, and pities me. Assure me that I yet may change these shadows you have shown me, by an altered life!”<br><br>“好精神，”他追问道，在他面前倒在地上：“你的本性为我辩护，同情我。请确保我还能通过改变生活来改变你向我展示的这些阴影！”<br><br><br><br>The kind hand trembled. 那只善良的手在颤抖。<br><br><br><br>“I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future. The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me. I will not shut out the lessons that they teach. Oh, tell me I may sponge away the writing on this stone!”<br><br>我将永远在心中纪念圣诞节，并努力让它贯穿全年。我将生活在过去、现在和未来。这三个时代的灵魂将在我内心奋斗。我不会拒绝他们所传授的教训。哦，告诉我，我能否擦去这块石头上的字迹！<br><br><br><br>In his agony, he caught the spectral hand. It sought to free itself, but he was strong in his entreaty, and detained it. The Spirit, stronger yet, repulsed him.<br><br>在他的痛苦中，他抓住了幽灵般的手。那手试图挣脱，但他恳求坚定，将它留住。幽灵的力量更加强大，将他推开。<br><br><br><br>Holding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate reversed, he saw an alteration in the Phantom’s hood and dress. It shrunk, collapsed, and dwindled down into a bedpost.<br><br>他举起双手，最后一次祈祷，希望改变自己的命运，他看到幽灵的斗篷和衣服发生了变化。它缩小、坍塌，最终变成了一根床柱。<br><br><br><br>STAVE FIVE. THE END OF IT. Yes! and the bedpost was his own. The bed was his own, the room was his own. Best and happiest of all, the Time before him was his own, to make amends in!<br><br>第五乐章。故事的终结。是的！床柱也是他的。床是他的，房间也是他的。最美好、最幸福的是，在他面前的时间也是他的，可以弥补过去！<br><br><br><br>“I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future!” Scrooge repeated, as he scrambled out of bed. “The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me. Oh Jacob Marley! Heaven, and the Christmas Time be praised for this! I say it on my knees, old Jacob; on my knees!”<br><br><br><br>He was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions, that his broken voice would scarcely answer to his call. He had been sobbing violently in his conflict with the Spirit, and his face was wet with tears.<br><br>“我要活在过去、现在和未来！”斯克鲁奇一边说着，一边从床上爬起来。“三个时代的精灵将在我内心奋斗。哦，雅各布·马利！赞美天堂和这个圣诞节！我在老雅各面前跪下说这句话！” 他因为满腔的好意而激动不已，以至于他的声音几乎无法回应他的呼唤。在与精灵的冲突中，他一直痛哭流涕，脸上湿漉漉的都是泪水。<br><br><br><br>“They are not torn down,” cried Scrooge, folding one of his bed-curtains in his arms, “they are not torn down, rings and all. They are here—I am here—the shadows of the things that would have been, may be dispelled. They will be. I know they will!”<br><br>“它们没有被拆毁，”斯克鲁奇喊道，一边把一条床帘抱在怀里，“它们没有被拆毁，连戒指都在。它们在这里——我在这里——那些本可能存在的事物的阴影可能被驱散了。它们会的。我知道它们会的！”<br><br><br><br>His hands were busy with his garments all this time; turning them inside out, putting them on upside down, tearing them, mislaying them, making them parties to every kind of extravagance.<br><br><br><br>“I don’t know what to do!” cried Scrooge, laughing and crying in the same breath; and making a perfect Laocoön of himself with his stockings. “I am as light as a feather, I am as happy as an angel, I am as merry as a schoolboy. I am as giddy as a drunken man. A merry Christmas to everybody! A happy New Year to all the world. Hallo here! Whoop! Hallo!”<br><br>他的手一直忙着整理他的衣服；把它们翻过来，倒着穿上，撕破它们，弄丢它们，让它们参与各种奢侈。 “我不知道该怎么办！”斯克鲁奇喊道，一边笑一边哭；同时用他的袜子把自己变成了一个完美的拉奥孔。“我轻得像羽毛，我快乐得像天使，我快乐得像小学生。我晕得像喝醉的人。祝大家圣诞快乐！祝全世界新年快乐。嗨，这里！呼啸！嗨！”<br><br><br><br>He had frisked into the sitting-room, and was now standing there: perfectly winded.<br><br>他冲进了客厅，现在正站在那里：气喘吁吁的。<br><br><br><br>“There’s the saucepan that the gruel was in!” cried Scrooge, starting off again, and going round the fireplace. “There’s the door, by which the Ghost of Jacob Marley entered! There’s the corner where the Ghost of Christmas Present, sat! There’s the window where I saw the wandering Spirits! It’s all right, it’s all true, it all happened. Ha ha ha!”<br><br>“那是装粥的锅！”斯克鲁奇叫道，又重新开始四处走动，绕着壁炉。“那是雅各布·马雷的鬼魂进来的门！那是圣诞老人的鬼魂坐过的角落！那是我看到那些游荡的鬼魂的窗户！一切都对了，都是真的，都发生了。哈哈哈！”<br><br><br><br>Really, for a man who had been out of practice for so many years, it was a splendid laugh, a most illustrious laugh. The father of a long, long line of brilliant laughs!<br><br>说实话，对于一个多年没有练习的人来说，这笑声太棒了，一个最辉煌的笑声。一个漫长而辉煌的笑声家族的父亲！<br><br><br><br>“I don’t know what day of the month it is!” said Scrooge. “I don’t know how long I’ve been among the Spirits. I don’t know anything. I’m quite a baby. Never mind. I don’t care. I’d rather be a baby. Hallo! Whoop! Hallo here!”<br><br>我不知道今天是哪一天！”斯克鲁奇说。“我不知道我在这些精灵中间待了多久。我什么都不知道。我简直是个婴儿。别管了。我不在乎。我宁愿做个婴儿。哈喽！哇哦！哈喽在这里！”<br><br><br><br>He was checked in his transports by the churches ringing out the lustiest peals he had ever heard. Clash, clang, hammer; ding, dong, bell. Bell, dong, ding; hammer, clang, clash! Oh, glorious, glorious!<br><br>教堂传来的最响亮的钟声打断了他的激动。叮当，铛铛，锤击；叮，咚，钟声。钟，咚，叮；锤击，铛铛，叮当！哦，辉煌，辉煌！<br><br><br><br>Running to the window, he opened it, and put out his head. No fog, no mist; clear, bright, jovial, stirring, cold; cold, piping for the blood to dance to; Golden sunlight; Heavenly sky; sweet fresh air; merry bells. Oh, glorious! Glorious!<br><br>他跑到窗前，打开窗户，把头伸出去。没有雾，没有雾气；清澈，明亮，欢乐，振奋，寒冷；寒冷，吹得血液沸腾；金色阳光；天堂般的天空；清新的空气；欢乐的钟声。哦，辉煌！辉煌！<br><br><br><br>“What’s to-day!” cried Scrooge, calling downward to a boy in Sunday clothes, who perhaps had loitered in to look about him.<br><br>今天是什么日子！”斯克鲁奇大声喊道，他向下对着一身周日服装的男孩喊话，这个男孩可能只是进来四处看看。<br><br><br><br>“Eh?” returned the boy, with all his might of wonder.<br><br>“嗯？”男孩带着全部的惊奇之力回答。<br><br><br><br>“What’s to-day, my fine fellow?” said Scrooge.<br><br>“今天是什么日子，我的好伙计？”斯克鲁奇说。<br><br><br><br>“To-day!” replied the boy. “Why, Christmas Day.”<br><br>“今天！”男孩回答道。“哎呀，圣诞节。”<br><br><br><br>“It’s Christmas Day!” said Scrooge to himself. “I haven’t missed it. The Spirits have done it all in one night. They can do anything they like. Of course they can. Of course they can. Hallo, my fine fellow!”<br><br>“今天是圣诞节！”斯克鲁奇自言自语道。“我没有错过。精灵们一夜之间就办好了。他们可以做任何他们想做的事情。当然可以。当然可以。喂，我的好朋友！”<br><br><br><br>“Hallo!” returned the boy.<br><br>“喂！”男孩回应道。<br><br><br><br>“Do you know the Poulterer’s, in the next street but one, at the corner?” Scrooge inquired.<br><br>您知道下一街区的肉铺吗？就在拐角处。”斯克鲁奇问道。<br><br><br><br>“I should hope I did,” replied the lad.<br><br>我应该希望我做到了，”那男孩回答道。<br><br><br><br>“An intelligent boy!” said Scrooge. “A remarkable boy! Do you know whether they’ve sold the prize Turkey that was hanging up there?—Not the little prize Turkey: the big one?”<br><br>一个聪明的男孩！”斯克鲁奇说。“一个了不起的男孩！你知道他们是否卖掉了挂在那里的那只获奖火鸡了吗？——不是那只小获奖火鸡：那只大的？”<br><br><br><br>“What, the one as big as me?” returned the boy.<br><br>“什么，和我一样大的那个？”男孩回答。<br><br><br><br>“What a delightful boy!” said Scrooge. “It’s a pleasure to talk to him. Yes, my buck!”<br><br>“多么可爱的男孩！”斯克鲁奇说。“和他交谈是一种乐趣。是的，我的小伙子！”<br><br><br><br>“It’s hanging there now,” replied the boy.<br><br>“它现在挂在那里，”男孩回答道。<br><br><br><br>“Is it?” said Scrooge. “Go and buy it.”<br><br>“是吗？”斯克鲁奇说，“去把它买下来。”<br><br><br><br>“Walk-er!” exclaimed the boy.<br><br>“沃克！”男孩惊叫道。<br><br><br><br>“No, no,” said Scrooge, “I am in earnest. Go and buy it, and tell ’em to bring it here, that I may give them the direction where to take it. Come back with the man, and I’ll give you a shilling. Come back with him in less than five minutes and I’ll give you half-a-crown!”<br><br>“不，不，”斯克鲁奇说，“我是认真的。去把它买下来，告诉他们把东西带到这里，我可以告诉他们该把东西送到哪里。和那个人一起回来，我会给你一先令。如果他五分钟内回来，我会给你半克朗！”<br><br><br><br>The boy was off like a shot. He must have had a steady hand at a trigger who could have got a shot off half so fast.<br><br>那个男孩像离弦之箭一样跑了出去。一个能在半秒内开枪的人，他的手一定很稳。<br><br><br><br>“I’ll send it to Bob Cratchit’s!” whispered Scrooge, rubbing his hands, and splitting with a laugh. “He sha’n’t know who sends it. It’s twice the size of Tiny Tim. Joe Miller never made such a joke as sending it to Bob’s will be!”<br><br>“我会把它送到鲍勃·克拉奇特的家里！”斯克鲁奇一边搓着手，一边笑着说道。“他不会知道是谁送来的。它比蒂尼·蒂姆大两倍。乔·米勒从未开过这么一个玩笑，把东西送到鲍勃那里去！”<br><br><br><br>The hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady one, but write it he did, somehow, and went down-stairs to open the street door, ready for the coming of the poulterer’s man. As he stood there, waiting his arrival, the knocker caught his eye.<br><br>他的手在写地址时并不稳定，但他还是设法写完了，然后下楼去打开街门，准备迎接屠夫的伙计。当他站在那里等待他的到来时，门环吸引了他的注意。<br><br><br><br>“I shall love it, as long as I live!” cried Scrooge, patting it with his hand. “I scarcely ever looked at it before. What an honest expression it has in its face! It’s a wonderful knocker!—Here’s the Turkey! Hallo! Whoop! How are you! Merry Christmas!”<br><br>刮胡子不是一件容易的事，因为他的手一直在剧烈颤抖；而刮胡子需要注意力，即使你在刮的时候不跳舞也是如此。但要是他割掉了自己的鼻子尖，他会贴上一块橡皮膏，并且非常满足。 “我会爱它的，直到我死去！”斯克鲁奇用手拍着它喊道。“我以前几乎没看过它。它脸上的表情多么诚实！这是一个神奇的门环！——这是火鸡！哈喽！呼啸！你好！圣诞快乐！”<br><br><br><br>It was a Turkey! He never could have stood upon his legs, that bird. He would have snapped ’em short off in a minute, like sticks of sealing-wax.<br><br><br><br>“Why, it’s impossible to carry that to Camden Town,” said Scrooge. “You must have a cab.”<br><br>“哎呀，把它带到坎登镇是不可能的，”斯克鲁奇说。“你必须打车。”<br><br><br><br>The chuckle with which he said this, and the chuckle with which he paid for the Turkey, and the chuckle with which he paid for the cab, and the chuckle with which he recompensed the boy, were only to be exceeded by the chuckle with which he sat down breathless in his chair again, and chuckled till he cried.<br><br>他这么说时的笑声，他付火鸡钱时的笑声，他付车费时的笑声，他给男孩报酬时的笑声，都只能被他在椅子上坐下，气喘吁吁地再次笑出声，笑到哭的笑声所超越。<br><br><br><br>Shaving was not an easy task, for his hand continued to shake very much; and shaving requires attention, even when you don’t dance while you are at it. But if he had cut the end of his nose off, he would have put a piece of sticking-plaister over it, and been quite satisfied.<br><br><br><br>He dressed himself “all in his best,” and at last got out into the streets. The people were by this time pouring forth, as he had seen them with the Ghost of Christmas Present; and walking with his hands behind him, Scrooge regarded every one with a delighted smile. He looked so irresistibly pleasant, in a word, that three or four good-humoured fellows said, “Good morning, sir! A merry Christmas to you!” And Scrooge said often afterwards, that of all the blithe sounds he had ever heard, those were the blithest in his ears.<br><br>他把自己打扮得“尽可能体面”，最后终于走出了街道。这时，人们正像他跟圣诞老人的鬼魂看到的那样涌出来；斯克鲁奇双手背在身后，带着愉快的微笑看着每一个人。总之，他看起来如此迷人，以至于有三四个和善的家伙说：“早上好，先生！祝您圣诞快乐！”斯克鲁奇后来常常说，在他所听过的所有欢快的声音中，那些是最让他感到欢快的。<br><br><br><br>He had not gone far, when coming on towards him he beheld the portly gentleman, who had walked into his counting-house the day before, and said, “Scrooge and Marley’s, I believe?” It sent a pang across his heart to think how this old gentleman would look upon him when they met; but he knew what path lay straight before him, and he took it.<br><br><br><br>“My dear sir,” said Scrooge, quickening his pace, and taking the old gentleman by both his hands. “How do you do? I hope you succeeded yesterday. It was very kind of you. A merry Christmas to you, sir!”<br><br>“亲爱的先生，”斯克鲁奇说着，加快了脚步，紧紧握住那位老先生的双手。“您好？我希望您昨天成功了。您真是太好了。祝您圣诞快乐，先生！”<br><br><br><br>“Mr. Scrooge?” “斯克鲁奇先生？”<br><br><br><br>“Yes,” said Scrooge. “That is my name, and I fear it may not be pleasant to you. Allow me to ask your pardon. And will you have the goodness”—here Scrooge whispered in his ear.<br><br>“是的，”斯克鲁奇说，“这就是我的名字，我担心这对你来说可能不太愉快。请原谅我。你愿意——”斯克鲁奇在他耳边低声说。<br><br><br><br>“Lord bless me!” cried the gentleman, as if his breath were taken away. “My dear Mr. Scrooge, are you serious?”<br><br><br><br>“If you please,” said Scrooge. “Not a farthing less. A great many back-payments are included in it, I assure you. Will you do me that favour?”<br><br><br><br>“My dear sir,” said the other, shaking hands with him. “I don’t know what to say to such munifi—”<br><br>它是一只火鸡！那只鸟根本不可能站立，否则它的腿马上就会被折断，就像封蜡的棍子一样。 “我亲爱的先生，”另一个人握着他的手说，“我不知道该对这样的慷慨——”<br><br><br><br>“Don’t say anything, please,” retorted Scrooge. “Come and see me. Will you come and see me?”<br><br>“请什么也别说，”斯克鲁奇反驳道，“来见我。你会来见我吗？”<br><br><br><br>“I will!” cried the old gentleman. And it was clear he meant to do it.<br><br>“我会！”那位老绅士喊道。很明显，他是认真的。<br><br><br><br>“Thank’ee,” said Scrooge. “I am much obliged to you. I thank you fifty times. Bless you!”<br><br>“谢谢你，”斯克鲁奇说。“非常感激你。我谢谢你五十次。祝福你！”<br><br><br><br>He went to church, and walked about the streets, and watched the people hurrying to and fro, and patted children on the head, and questioned beggars, and looked down into the kitchens of houses, and up to the windows, and found that everything could yield him pleasure. He had never dreamed that any walk—that anything—could give him so much happiness. In the afternoon he turned his steps towards his nephew’s house.<br><br>他去了教堂，在街道上漫步，观察人们匆忙来去，抚摸孩子的头，询问乞丐，窥视房子的厨房，仰望窗户，发现一切都能给他带来快乐。他从未想过任何散步——任何事——能给他带来如此多的幸福。下午，他朝着侄子的家走去。<br><br><br><br>He passed the door a dozen times, before he had the courage to go up and knock. But he made a dash, and did it:<br><br>他经过那扇门十二次，才鼓起勇气走上前去敲门。但他冲了过去，真的敲了。<br><br><br><br>“Is your master at home, my dear?” said Scrooge to the girl. Nice girl! Very.<br><br>“你亲爱的主人在家吗？”斯克鲁奇对女孩说。好女孩！非常。<br><br><br><br>“Yes, sir.” 是的，先生。<br><br><br><br>“Where is he, my love?” said Scrooge.<br><br>他在哪里，我的爱人？”斯克鲁奇说。<br><br><br><br>“He’s in the dining-room, sir, along with mistress. I’ll show you up-stairs, if you please.”<br><br>他在餐厅，先生，还有女主人。如果您愿意，我可以带您上楼。<br><br><br><br>“Thank’ee. He knows me,” said Scrooge, with his hand already on the dining-room lock. “I’ll go in here, my dear.”<br><br>谢谢。他知道我，”Scrooge 说着，手已经放在餐厅的锁上了。“亲爱的，我就进去这里。”<br><br><br><br>He turned it gently, and sidled his face in, round the door. They were looking at the table (which was spread out in great array); for these young housekeepers are always nervous on such points, and like to see that everything is right.<br><br>他轻轻地转动它，把脸侧向门内。他们正在看桌子（上面摆满了丰盛的菜肴）；因为这些年轻的管家们总是对此类事情感到紧张，喜欢看到一切井然有序。<br><br><br><br>“Fred!” said Scrooge. “弗雷德！”斯克鲁奇说。<br><br><br><br>Dear heart alive, how his niece by marriage started! Scrooge had forgotten, for the moment, about her sitting in the corner with the footstool, or he wouldn’t have done it, on any account.<br><br>亲爱的，他的侄女（通过婚姻）多么激动！斯克鲁奇一时间忘记了她在角落里坐着，脚踩着脚凳，否则他无论如何也不会这么做。<br><br><br><br>“Why bless my soul!” cried Fred, “who’s that?”<br><br>“为什么祝福我的灵魂！”弗雷德喊道，“那是谁？”<br><br><br><br>“It’s I. Your uncle Scrooge. I have come to dinner. Will you let me in, Fred?”<br><br>“是我。你的叔叔斯克鲁奇。我来参加晚宴了。你能让我进去吗，弗雷德？”<br><br><br><br>Let him in! It is a mercy he didn’t shake his arm off. He was at home in five minutes. Nothing could be heartier. His niece looked just the same. So did Topper when he came. So did the plump sister when she came. So did every one when they came. Wonderful party, wonderful games, wonderful unanimity, won-der-ful happiness!<br><br>让他进来！幸亏他没有把他的手臂甩掉。他五分钟就到家了。再热情不过了。他的侄女看起来还是一样。当他到来时，托珀也是。当他到来时，那个丰满的妹妹也是。当他们到来时，每个人都是。精彩的聚会，精彩的游戏，一致的意见，幸福无比！<br><br><br><br>But he was early at the office next morning. Oh, he was early there. If he could only be there first, and catch Bob Cratchit coming late! That was the thing he had set his heart upon.<br><br>但他第二天早上很早就到了办公室。哦，他确实很早到那里。如果他能够先到那里，然后看到鲍勃·克雷奇特迟到！那正是他一心想要做到的事情。<br><br><br><br>And he did it; yes, he did! The clock struck nine. No Bob. A quarter past. No Bob. He was full eighteen minutes and a half behind his time. Scrooge sat with his door wide open, that he might see him come into the Tank.<br><br>他做到了；是的，他做到了！钟敲响了九点。没有鲍勃。九点十五分。没有鲍勃。他比规定时间晚了十八分半。斯克鲁奇坐在门大敞着的地方，以便看到他走进罐子。<br><br><br><br>His hat was off, before he opened the door; his comforter too. He was on his stool in a jiffy; driving away with his pen, as if he were trying to overtake nine o’clock.<br><br>他在开门之前摘下了帽子；他的毯子也摘了下来。他立刻坐在了凳子上；用笔飞快地写着，好像在试图赶上九点。<br><br><br><br>“Hallo!” growled Scrooge, in his accustomed voice, as near as he could feign it. “What do you mean by coming here at this time of day?”<br><br>“哈喽！”斯克鲁奇咆哮道，尽量模仿他习惯的语气，“你这是什么意思，大白天跑来？”<br><br><br><br>“I am very sorry, sir,” said Bob. “I am behind my time.”<br><br><br><br>“You are?” repeated Scrooge. “Yes. I think you are. Step this way, sir, if you please.”<br><br>“你是谁？”斯克鲁奇重复道。“是的。我想你是。请这边走，先生。”<br><br><br><br>“It’s only once a year, sir,” pleaded Bob, appearing from the Tank. “It shall not be repeated. I was making rather merry yesterday, sir.”<br><br>“一年只有一次，先生，”鲍勃从坦克里出来，恳求道，“不会重复的。我昨天玩得很开心，先生。”<br><br><br><br>“Now, I’ll tell you what, my friend,” said Scrooge, “I am not going to stand this sort of thing any longer. And therefore,” he continued, leaping from his stool, and giving Bob such a dig in the waistcoat that he staggered back into the Tank again; “and therefore I am about to raise your salary!”<br><br>现在，我要告诉你，朋友，”斯克鲁奇说，“我再也忍受不了这种事情了。因此，”他继续说，从他的凳子上跳起来，在鲍勃的背心上一推，让他又踉跄着回到了水箱里；“因此，我打算给你加薪！”<br><br><br><br>Bob trembled, and got a little nearer to the ruler. He had a momentary idea of knocking Scrooge down with it, holding him, and calling to the people in the court for help and a strait-waistcoat.<br><br>鲍勃颤抖着，慢慢地靠近了统治者。他突然想到可以用它把斯克鲁奇打倒，然后抓住他，向法庭里的人呼救，并要求他们帮忙，给他一件紧身衣。<br><br><br><br>“A merry Christmas, Bob!” said Scrooge, with an earnestness that could not be mistaken, as he clapped him on the back. “A merrier Christmas, Bob, my good fellow, than I have given you, for many a year! I’ll raise your salary, and endeavour to assist your struggling family, and we will discuss your affairs this very afternoon, over a Christmas bowl of smoking bishop, Bob! Make up the fires, and buy another coal-scuttle before you dot another i, Bob Cratchit!”<br><br>圣诞快乐，鲍勃！斯克鲁奇真诚地说，一边拍着他的背。“比往年更快乐的圣诞节，鲍勃，我的好朋友！我会给你加薪，尽力帮助你那贫困的家庭，我们今天下午就讨论你的事务，鲍勃！点起火，在你画完最后一个点之前，再买一个煤斗，鲍勃·克拉奇特！”<br><br><br><br>Scrooge and Bob Cratchit Scrooge was better than his word. He did it all, and infinitely more; and to Tiny Tim, who did not die, he was a second father. He became as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew, or any other good old city, town, or borough, in the good old world. Some people laughed to see the alteration in him, but he let them laugh, and little heeded them; for he was wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this globe, for good, at which some people did not have their fill of laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as these would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they should wrinkle up their eyes in grins, as have the malady in less attractive forms. His own heart laughed: and that was quite enough for him.<br><br>“非常抱歉，先生，”鲍勃说，“我迟到了。” 斯克鲁奇和鲍勃·克雷奇特斯克鲁奇比他的话做得更好。他做到了一切，而且做得更多；对于没有死去的蒂尼·蒂姆，他就像第二个父亲。他成为了一个像善良的老城市一样好、像其他任何善良的老城市、城镇或自治市镇一样好的人，他是善良的老世界所知道的，或者任何其他善良的老世界。有些人看到他的变化而笑，但他让他们笑，几乎不关心他们；因为他足够聪明，知道在这个地球上，对于好事，有些人一开始就没有足够的笑声；而且知道这些人无论如何都会是盲目的，他认为他们应该皱起眼睛笑，就像有病但不太吸引人的形式一样。他自己的心笑了：这对他来说已经足够了。<br><br><br><br>He had no further intercourse with Spirits, but lived upon the Total Abstinence Principle, ever afterwards; and it was always said of him, that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge. May that be truly said of us, and all of us! And so, as Tiny Tim observed, God bless Us, Every One!<br><br>他与精灵再无交往，此后一直遵循禁酒原则；人们常说，如果世上有人懂得如何过好圣诞节，那一定是他。愿这同样能被我们所有人真正地说出！正如蒂尼·蒂姆所观察到的，愿上帝保佑我们每一个人！<br><br>
